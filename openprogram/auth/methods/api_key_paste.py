"""API key paste flow — the degenerate "login" that's just a secret prompt.

Used by providers that don't have OAuth: OpenAI direct, Groq, Together,
custom vLLM deployments with a shared key, anything where the user is
expected to have a raw key string. Still wrapped in the :class:`LoginMethod`
interface so the settings UI can treat every auth flow uniformly — a
user adding a new account doesn't need to know whether it's OAuth or a
key paste, they just pick the provider.

Validation is intentionally minimal: we only reject empty strings. Format
validation lives at the HTTP layer when the first real call happens
(where we have the actual "does this key work" signal). False-positive
format checks here would let obsolete validation rules block valid keys;
the API itself is authoritative.
