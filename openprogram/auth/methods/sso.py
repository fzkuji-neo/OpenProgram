"""Enterprise SSO placeholder.

Reserved as the canonical integration point for SAML / OIDC-through-
broker / corporate identity providers. Not implemented: the protocols
vary too much between vendors (Okta, Azure AD, Ping, Auth0 as IdP,
custom) for a single generic implementation to be useful, and the
feature has no real users today.

What this stub guarantees:

  * the ``sso`` credential kind is already registered in
    :mod:`auth.types`, so code that branches on ``cred.kind`` handles
    it with a :class:`NotImplementedError` today and a real branch later
  * the :class:`SsoStubMethod` class exists so provider plugins that
    want to advertise "we support SSO, call us to wire it" can do so
    without their settings UI breaking on a missing import
  * docstring + ``run()`` raise a clear error pointing callers at the
    issue tracker so the failure mode is "go tell us what IdP you use",
    not "framework bug"

When a real implementation lands it should keep the :class:`LoginMethod`
interface unchanged — the plugin layer (provider_auth config) is the
only place that should need updating.
