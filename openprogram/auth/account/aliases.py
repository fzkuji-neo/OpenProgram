"""Provider alias table — short names users type on the CLI.

The canonical provider id matches OpenAI's official naming where one
exists (``openai-codex``, ``gemini-subscription``, ``github-copilot``);
on the CLI people type spoken-word shortcuts (``codex``, ``claude``,
``gemini``, ``copilot``). This module resolves those shortcuts.

Design:

* One-way alias → canonical. We never print the alias back; all output
  uses the canonical id so logs are unambiguous.
* Resolution is a pure function; no side effects, no registry mutation
  from user code.
* Aliases live here, not in each provider dir, so that conflicts are
  visible at review time (two providers can't claim the same alias
  without the conflict showing in one PR).

To add a new alias: edit :data:`_ALIASES`. That's it.
