"""Feed provider call outcomes back to the credential pool so rotation /
cooldown / fallback actually engage.

The pool machinery (``auth/pool.py``) cools a credential down on failure and
skips it on the next acquire — but ONLY if someone reports the failure. These
helpers are that someone: the provider call path acquires a credential via
:func:`acquire_pooled` (recording exactly which one it used), then reports the
result via :func:`record_call_success` / :func:`record_call_failure`. A 429 on key #0 cools
it down; the outer runtime retry re-acquires and the pool hands back key #1.

No-op unless the provider has an AuthStore pool: env-key / OAuth / claude-code
providers (which resolve their token elsewhere) get ``None`` from
:func:`acquire_pooled` and never report, so nothing changes for them.

Telemetry must never break a request — every reporting call swallows its own
errors.

    default. Returns ``None`` when the provider has no AuthStore pool (the

    rotates across ALL the provider's accounts (accounts) by the chosen strategy,
