"""
Auth v2 — credential pool rotation + cooldown bookkeeping.

A :class:`CredentialPool` (in :mod:`.types`) holds several credentials
for one ``(provider, account)``. This module decides which one the next
API call should use, and what happens to a credential that just returned
401 / 402 / 429 / 503.

Four strategies, all aware of cooldowns and disabled credentials:

  * ``fill_first``   — use index 0 while it's healthy; the rest only
    matter when the primary is cooling down. Matches the "backup key"
    mental model most users already have.
  * ``round_robin``  — cycle through healthy credentials. Good hedge
    against rate limits when all keys share the same quota bucket.
  * ``random``       — uniform pick among healthy credentials. Useful
    for fanout patterns where predictability leaks metadata.
  * ``least_used``   — pick the healthy credential with the lowest
    ``use_count``. Self-balancing across long-lived processes.

The pool never mutates a credential except to record usage / cooldown.
Writes that matter for persistence (refresh results, status changes) go
through :class:`AuthStore` so every mutation gets an event + file write
with the existing lock guarantees.

401/402/429 handling is a two-function split:

  * :func:`mark_failure` translates an HTTP-ish error into a cooldown +
    status update. The manager calls this when an API call raises.
  * :func:`pick` returns the next healthy credential, rotating if
    necessary; the manager calls this before dispatching an API call.

Keeping policy (strategy) separate from mechanism (cooldown bookkeeping)
means adding a fifth strategy later touches ~15 lines in one place.
