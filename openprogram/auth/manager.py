"""
Auth v2 — the runtime face of credential management.

This is what every API-calling code path reaches for. It wraps
:class:`AuthStore` + :mod:`.pool` with the two behaviours the raw layers
can't provide on their own:

  * **Refresh dedup.** Multiple concurrent calls near token expiry all
    hit one :meth:`acquire`; only the first actually performs a refresh,
    everyone else awaits its result. Implemented with per-pool
    in-flight :class:`asyncio.Future` plus the :class:`AuthStore` async
    lock (so cross-process mtime reloads also serialize against us).
    Pattern is the one Hermes lifted from Claude Code.

  * **Fallback chains.** If a pool is exhausted (every key cooling down,
    revoked, or needing reauth), the manager walks the configured
    fallback chain — ``[(provider_id, profile_id), ...]`` — trying the
    next one. This is the only place that knows about fallback; pools
    don't chain, runtimes don't reimplement it.

The manager is deliberately refresh-agnostic: it accepts a
``RefreshFn`` callable supplied by the provider plugin (or inferred
from :class:`Credential.kind`). That keeps the manager free of httpx /
pi-ai dependencies, so tests can exercise the full state machine with
a fake refresh that just increments a counter.
