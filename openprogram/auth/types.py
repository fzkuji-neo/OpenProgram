"""
Auth v2 — type definitions.

Design goals that shape every type here:

  - one process-wide source of truth (:class:`AuthStore`) keyed by
    ``(provider_id, account_id)``; every runtime asks the store, never
    caches its own copy
  - credentials are a tagged union so future auth kinds (SSO, hardware
    keys, enterprise JWT brokers) drop in without touching call sites
  - every state transition emits an :class:`AuthEvent` so telemetry,
    "your session expires in 5 min" UI, and audit logs can subscribe
    without the core knowing about them
  - errors are typed so the webui can distinguish "refresh hiccup, retry
    automatically" from "user really does need to re-auth" without
    string-matching traceback messages
  - every credential source declares :class:`RemovalStep` list so
    "forget this account" is actually complete — no surprise
    re-hydration from a forgotten env var or CLI store

Nothing here imports httpx, fastapi, or pi-ai. The type layer stays
framework-agnostic so tests can exercise the full state machine without
network.

    Two concrete uses today:

    - ``kind="external_file"`` + ``store_path=~/.claude/.credentials.json``
