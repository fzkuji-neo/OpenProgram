"""On-load migration of stored credential JSON to the current schema.

Runtime code only understands the current shape; everything older is
rewritten here, in place and atomically, before it reaches
``Credential.from_dict``. Two steps, applied in order:

  * **v1 → v2** — old 6-payload JSON (carrying a ``__type__``
    discriminator) becomes the flat :class:`CredentialData` structure
    (see ``types._payload_from_dict``).
  * **v2 → v3** — the two auth renames land on disk: the credential
    ``kind`` value ``"external_process"`` becomes ``"credential_process"``,
    and the ``profile_id`` field (on pools and credentials alike) becomes
    ``account_id``.

Every step is idempotent: data already in the current shape is left
untouched, so a repeated load is a cheap no-op. Old formats are not
supported after migration — reads go through the migrated shape only.
