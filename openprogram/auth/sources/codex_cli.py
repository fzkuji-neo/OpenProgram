"""Adopt credentials from the Codex CLI's on-disk auth file.

The Codex CLI stores OAuth tokens at ``~/.codex/auth.json`` (or
``$CODEX_HOME/auth.json`` when set). We read the file non-destructively
and register a ``CredentialData(kind="cli_delegated")`` credential that
points at it.
"Delegated" mode means we never copy the secret bytes into our own
store — every API call re-reads the file — so Codex CLI's own rotations
propagate to us for free.

Key shape in Codex's file (observed as of 2026-04):

  {
    "OPENAI_API_KEY": null,                    # unused when tokens present
    "tokens": {
      "id_token": "...",
      "access_token": "...",
      "refresh_token": "...",
      "account_id": "...",
    },
    "last_refresh": "2026-04-21T15:13:02.1234Z"
  }

Codex's access token doesn't carry an ``expires_at`` — the CLI refreshes
opportunistically on 401. We encode that by leaving ``expires_key_path``
empty; the manager then treats this as "trust the CLI, it'll refresh
when needed".

    behind ``cli_delegated`` mode — every read re-checks the file so

    Without the binary that contract is a lie: the file just rots,
    refresh tokens get consumed by other processes, and the in-process
