"""Environment-variable API-key source.

Handles the long-suffering ``OPENAI_API_KEY`` / ``ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`` /
``GOOGLE_API_KEY`` pattern. One source instance per ``(provider_id,
env_var_name)`` pair — providers that accept multiple env var names
(``GOOGLE_API_KEY`` vs ``GEMINI_API_KEY``) register one source per alias
and each independently offers to import.

Why this is a source and not a login method:
the user didn't *log in* — the secret was already sitting in their
shell. We're only adopting it. That distinction matters for the removal
contract: we can't ``unset`` their shell for them, so removal is
instructional (``executable=False``).
