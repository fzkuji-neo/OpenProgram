"""Git-backed storage: session memory, the project entity layer, and the
file revert/record machinery. See ``README.md`` in this directory for the
full map; this docstring covers the original session-storage core.

The directory holds three groups (README has the details):

  1. **Session storage** — one git repo per conversation. The original
     job of this package: ``session_store`` / ``git_session`` /
     ``memory_index`` / ``session_node_writer`` / ``_msg_adapter`` /
     ``search``. Replaces the old SQLite ``DagSessionDB`` + ``GraphStore``.
  2. **Project entity layer + auto-commit** — ``project_store`` (the
     user's working dir as a git-backed Project, with safe auto-init and
     a reset/revert-of-a-commit primitive) and ``project_commit`` (wires
     the agent's per-turn edits into that repo). See
     ``docs/design/memory/overview.md`` and ``docs/design/runtime/file-management.md``.
  3. **Revert / record helpers** — ``checkpoint/`` (per-turn file
     checkpoints = the "undo" layer) and ``read_tracking`` (read-before-
     edit concurrency guard). See ``docs/design/runtime/file-management.md``.

Public surface (re-exported for legacy import paths):

    SessionStore        ─ main class, implements DagSessionDB-compatible
                          22 public methods on top of git repos
    default_store()     ─ process-wide singleton
    GitSession          ─ per-session git repo wrapper (init / add /
                          commit / log / checkout)
    SessionMemoryIndex  ─ per-session in-memory DAG index, rebuilt
                          from git on startup / cache miss

Storage layout: every session is its own git repo at
``~/.openprogram/sessions/<session_id>/`` (ad-hoc chats) — or inside a
bound project at ``<project>/.openprogram/sessions/<session_id>/``
(indexed by ``sessions/locations.json``). Each repo has two top-level
dirs:

    history/   append-only JSON files, one per DAG node, named
               ``NNNN-{u|a|t|s|...}-<id>.json`` where NNNN is the
               4-digit zero-padded seq. Never modified after write.

    context/   the LLM view. ``commits/<id>.json`` carries per-commit
               ContextItem lists, written one immutable file per turn
               by ``context.commit.store.save_commit``. There is no
               ``messages.json`` mirror — every read looks the commit up
               by id / DAG ancestry, not via a shared mutable file.

Plus ``meta.json`` at the repo root for session-level fields (title,
agent_id, head_id, ...).

Git is the source of truth. The in-memory index is a query cache,
fully rebuildable from git on demand. See
``docs/design/memory/git-as-entity-memory.md`` for the rationale.
