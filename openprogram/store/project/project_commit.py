"""Project-Git auto-commit — wire the agent's file edits into the user's
real repo as attributable commits (entity layer, half 2).

A project-bound session works in the user's actual directory. Every turn
the agent may edit files there. This module makes that turn-end commit
happen so the user gets a ``git log`` of exactly what the agent changed
and can ``git revert`` any of it — the "compare / record what changed"
the entity layer promises.

Two call sites in the dispatcher:

  * :func:`snapshot_baseline` — at turn START, record which paths were
    already dirty (the user's uncommitted work).
  * :func:`commit_turn_changes` — at turn END, commit the agent's edits,
    but refuse (Strategy A) if the user's pre-turn changes are still
    sitting in the tree, so we never fold the user's half-done work into
    an agent commit.

Both are best-effort and fully guarded: a project/git failure must never
break a chat turn. Ad-hoc (default-project) sessions are no-ops — they
have no bound directory, their entity memory is the session repo itself.

**On by default.** When the agent edits files in a bound folder, the
turn-end commit records them. If the folder isn't a git repo yet,
auto-init turns it into one — safely: a baseline commit of the user's
pre-existing files first (so agent commits are honest diffs, not a bulk
"agent added your whole project"), and a refusal if a dep/build dir
(node_modules, .venv, …) would bloat that first commit. Opt out via
``project_auto_commit: false`` in ``~/.openprogram/config.json`` (or env
``OPENPROGRAM_PROJECT_AUTOCOMMIT=0``).

Rule B: when the session has an active git worktree, the agent's edits
live in the worktree copy, so this yields entirely (the worktree has its
own merge/discard lifecycle).
