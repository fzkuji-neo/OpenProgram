"""Project entity layer + auto-commit.

Group ② of ``store/`` (see ``store/README.md`` and
``docs/design/memory/overview.md`` / ``file-management.md``). Treats the user's
working directory as a git-backed *project* and records the agent's
per-turn edits there as attributable commits.

Modules:
  * ``project_store``   — Project + ProjectGit (safe auto-init,
                          agent-attributed commits / Strategy A, and the
                          reset/revert-of-a-commit primitive) + the
                          projects.json registry helpers.
  * ``project_commit``  — wires the agent's per-turn edits into the
                          project repo at turn end (rules A/B, default-on).
