"""Record a project relocation as a DAG node (dag/overview.md §7).

A session's main working directory freezes on its first turn, so the one
thing that may still change it is a **repair**: the bound project's
folder was moved or renamed on disk and the user points OpenProgram at
the new location. That is a change to where every later turn runs, so it
goes into the graph rather than mutating the registry silently.

Shape (§3), the same as ``context/system_prompt``: ``role=code``,
``caller="ROOT"``, ``predecessor=None``. The write invariant constrains
only conversational nodes (role user/llm), and because ``caller`` is set
the store does not advance head — recording a relocation never moves the
branch tip.

The name is ``project/relocate``, deliberately NOT under ``context/``:
context nodes are pipeline machinery hidden from the transcript, while a
relocation is a user action whose record is worth seeing.
