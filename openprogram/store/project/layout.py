"""Where a project's things live on disk.

Every project, the System project included, owns one folder under the
state directory::

    <state>/projects/
      projects.json              the project registry
      <project-id>/
        settings.json            project defaults
        chats/<session-id>/      its conversations
        memory/                  its memory workspace

The System project (id ``default``) holds the conversations that belong to
no project, and its memory is the personal memory every project reads
beside its own.

The conversation store keeps its bookkeeping (summary index, location map,
locks, tombstones) in hidden entries of the same ``projects/`` folder, so
a listing of it shows only the registry and the project folders.
