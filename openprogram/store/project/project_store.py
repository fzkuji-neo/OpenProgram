"""Project entity memory — the second half of the entity layer.

The entity (实体) tier of OpenProgram memory has two kinds of
git-backed stores (see ``docs/design/memory/overview.md`` §2):

  * **Session-Git** (already built, ``git_session.py``) — one repo per
    conversation, every turn a commit.
  * **Project-Git** (this module) — one repo per *project*, where a
    project is a long-lived working unit bound to a filesystem
    directory. Agent file edits in that directory get committed here.

Every session belongs to exactly one project. Two cases:

  * **Bound project** — the user worked in a real directory (their
    code / docs repo). That directory IS the project git repo; we
    reuse its ``.git`` if it has one, else ``git init`` it.
  * **Default project** — the catch-all for ad-hoc chats that never
    named a directory. Lives in the home hidden dir at
    ``<state>/projects/default/`` as its own git repo, so there is
    never a session with no project home.

Both auto-create their git repo on first use, mirroring how
``GitSession`` lazily ``git init``s a session repo on first write.

Registry: ``<state>/projects/projects.json`` maps ``project_id`` →
metadata (name, path, sessions, status). The registry is the index;
the git repos are the truth.

Cross-platform: all git calls go through ``git -C <path> ...`` via
subprocess (no cwd dependence), same as ``git_session._run``.
