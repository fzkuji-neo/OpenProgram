"""Provenance read-layer — the seam memory maps from.

The entity layer (git-backed session DAG + per-turn commits + the
project working-dir repo) is the ground truth that memory distills into
its virtual layer. This module is the thin, **LLM-free** read surface
that exposes the entity layer as *coordinates* memory can map onto:

  * ``iter_nodes_since`` — incremental node cursor (only what's new
    since the last ingest pass);
  * ``node_provenance``  — a node → ``Provenance`` coordinate;
  * ``session_commits``  — the session repo's per-turn commit history
    (delegates to ``SessionStore.session_commits``);
  * ``project_commits``  — the project working-dir repo's
    agent-attributed commit history.

Why it lives on the store side, not inside ``memory/``: memory is
pluggable (``MemoryBackend``). Keeping "how to read the git DAG +
provenance" here means any memory backend (builtin / mem0 / a graph DB)
maps the *same* stable surface instead of each re-deriving the git
layout. The entity layer owns "expose mappable coordinates"; memory owns
"map them into whatever shape it wants". See
docs/design/memory/entity-session-cache.md §5 and overview.md §3.1
(bi-temporal provenance).

Nothing here calls an LLM, so it is cheap and unit-testable in isolation
— the Phase-2 extractor (the expensive LLM pass that turns these
coordinates into timeline events / graph edges) sits *above* this layer.
