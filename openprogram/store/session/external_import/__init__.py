"""Import Claude Code and Codex conversations as OpenProgram sessions.

  * ``claude_code`` / ``codex`` — find and parse each agent's transcripts
                                  into the neutral ``model`` shape.
  * ``sanitize``               — drop host-injected context from user text.
  * ``writer``                 — write turns as native DAG nodes.
  * ``ledger``                 — what was imported where, for re-imports.
  * ``service``                — ``list_candidates`` / ``import_transcripts``.
