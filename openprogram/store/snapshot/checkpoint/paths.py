"""Path hashing + directory layout for mutation recovery snapshots.

The backup store mirrors Claude Code's fileHistory.ts in spirit: keep
original copies of files BEFORE an agent's first edit in a given turn,
keyed by ``(turn_id, original_path)``. Restoring a turn means walking
its directory and copying each backup back to its original location.

Layout::

    ~/.openprogram/sessions/.file-recovery/<session_id>/
    └── <turn_id>/
        ├── manifest.json     # { backup_basename → original_abs_path }
        ├── <hash>.<version>   # immutable before image
        └── <hash>.after.<version>  # immutable after image

``<hash>`` is a short content-addressed-ish basename derived from the
original path (we want backups to be readable when humans poke around,
not collision-free across paths). Legacy unsuffixed blobs remain readable. Referenced versions are retained
until their turn is pruned; files are never overwritten in place.
The manifest is the source of truth
for "which backup belongs to which path".
