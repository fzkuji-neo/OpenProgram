"""Centralized filesystem paths for OpenProgram state.

Single source of truth so ``--profile <name>`` / ``OPENPROGRAM_PROFILE``
reroute every config / sessions / logs read to an isolated dir. Before
this module existed, ~8 sites hard-coded ``~/.agentic/...`` which meant
profile isolation was impossible without touching each one.

Profile resolution order (checked lazily on each call, so CLI argparse
can set the env var before any getter runs):

    1. ``OPENPROGRAM_PROFILE`` env var — wins.
    2. Default profile = writes to ``~/.openprogram/`` (legacy
       ``~/.agentic/`` data is migrated in once; see ``get_state_dir``).

Usage:

    from openprogram.paths import get_config_path, get_sessions_dir
    cfg = json.loads(get_config_path().read_text())

Do NOT cache the returned paths in module-level constants — tests
switch profiles via env var and the ``--profile`` flag changes the
active profile after import.
