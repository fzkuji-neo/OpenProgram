"""AGENTS.md instructions, layered by directory.

Instructions come from one file name, ``AGENTS.md``, at three kinds of
place, the way Codex and Claude Code read theirs:

1. **Global** — ``<state>/AGENTS.md`` (``~/.openprogram/AGENTS.md``),
   for every project.
2. **Project chain** — every ``AGENTS.md`` from the project root (the
   nearest ancestor of the working directory holding ``.git``; the working
   directory itself when there is none) down to the working directory, in
   that order. Nothing above the project root is read.
3. **Nested** — an ``AGENTS.md`` in a directory the agent reaches later,
   below the working directory or in another project, is attached to the
   result of the first file tool that touches a file there, once per
   session.

Later files are closer to the work, so they are more specific and win on a
conflict. Global and chain files go into the system prompt within
``MAX_BYTES`` together.
