"""BudgetAllocator — slice the context window into purpose-named slots.

The naive view treats the window as one number ("I have 200K tokens").
The honest view: every turn spends tokens on **four** distinct things
that have different growth rates and different cache properties:

    system_prompt   — system + agent persona + skills index + memory
                      Slow growth, high cache value.
    tools_schema    — JSON schemas of every tool you handed the model.
                      Constant within a session; invalidates if tools
                      change.
    history         — past user / assistant / tool_result messages.
                      Grows ~linearly with turns; the only one we
                      compact.
    output_reserve  — held back so the model can actually respond.
                      Without this, a 195K/200K context silently caps
                      completions at 5K tokens.

Reserving output explicitly lets the engine make smarter decisions
("history can grow to 180K because tools+system+output = 20K") rather
than the dispatcher hard-coding ``reserveTokens=16384`` everywhere.
