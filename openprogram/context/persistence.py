"""Persister — write compaction results back to SessionDB as DAG nodes.

OpenProgram's distinguishing feature vs the reference platforms: a
compaction is a real *commit* in the message DAG. The summary is an
ordinary ``role=llm`` node that stands in for the range it replaces::

    parent ─┬─ covered[0] ── ... ── covered[-1] ── kept_tail ── HEAD
            └─ summary_node   (metadata.covers_ids = covered ids)

The summary node's ``predecessor`` is the predecessor of the FIRST node
it covers, so it sits exactly where the covered segment began.
``metadata.covers_ids`` records the exact chain nodes it replaces — ids,
not a seq interval, because seqs of sibling branches interleave
(context/compaction.md §2). ``render_context`` substitutes the segment
with the summary on any chain that contains it (§3); the graph folds the
same ids behind the capsule (dag/rendering.md §9).

Nothing is cloned, nothing is deleted, and HEAD does not move: the
append rule only advances head on chain extension, and a summary is a
mid-chain splice. The pre-compaction view stays reachable by ignoring
the summary.

This module owns just the DB-write side of that contract. Decisions
about *when* to compact and *what* the summary text contains live in
the engine and summarizer respectively.
