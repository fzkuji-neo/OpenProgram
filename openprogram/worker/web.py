"""Manage the Next.js frontend subprocess.

The worker hosts a FastAPI backend on a free port, and the Next.js
frontend on its own port. The Next.js process speaks to the backend
through Next's rewrites (configured to read ``OPENPROGRAM_BACKEND_URL``
at startup), so the user only ever sees the Next.js URL.

Lifecycle:
- :func:`start_web_frontend` spawns ``npm run start`` in ``web/``,
  passing ``OPENPROGRAM_BACKEND_URL=http://127.0.0.1:<backend_port>``.
- If ``apps/web/.next/`` is missing it builds first.
- If ``node`` / ``npm`` is unavailable, returns ``None`` and the worker
  continues without the frontend (user can still use TUI).
- The returned :class:`subprocess.Popen` is stored so we can ``terminate``
  it on worker shutdown.
