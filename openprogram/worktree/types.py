"""Worktree entity + state machine.

State transitions per ``docs/design/runtime/agent-worktree.md`` D3:

    create
       |
       v
    active --merge--> merged
       |
       +--discard--> discarded
       |
       +--keep--> kept
       |
       +--(merge fails)--> errored (back to active visually, but stamped
                                    error message — caller can retry or
                                    discard)

Terminal states are ``merged`` / ``discarded`` / ``kept`` / ``errored``
— absorbing. ``committing`` is a brief in-flight state used while a
``git merge`` is running, gating concurrent ops. The entity is plain
data; subprocess invocation lives in the manager.
