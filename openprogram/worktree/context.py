"""``_current_worktree_path`` ContextVar — the bridge between
worktree management and the in-process tools.

Mirrors the model used by
``openprogram.agent.run_control._current_session_id``: workers /
tool dispatchers bind the var at the top of an execution and reset
it on exit. Tools read it in their bodies (bash backend.run cwd,
edit/write/read relative-path resolution) without an explicit
parameter — the dispatcher owns the binding so the LLM-callable
surface doesn't grow a worktree argument.

The var defaults to ``None`` (no worktree). Tool fallback is
"behave as before": bash gets no cwd override, file tools require
absolute paths.

ContextVars do NOT propagate across ``threading.Thread`` start; the
JobRunner already copies the parent context with ``contextvars.copy_context``
when submitting work to its pool, so a worktree bound in the dispatcher's
thread reaches workers transparently.
