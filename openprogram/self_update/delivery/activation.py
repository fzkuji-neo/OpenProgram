"""Decide how much of the installed App a candidate has to rebuild and restart.

The installed App records the commit it was built from in
``Contents/Resources/openprogram-source-revision``. Every path that differs
between that commit and the candidate maps to one component. A component
names what has to be rebuilt and the least disruptive way to bring it live:

* ``hot``: files the running processes read from disk per request (the Web
  export, the docs site, the terminal UI bundle). The bundle is swapped while
  the App and the worker keep running; open pages reload themselves.
* ``worker``: Python code. The worker restarts on the new bundle; the App
  window stays open and shows the updating page meanwhile.
* ``app``: the Electron shell. The App quits and reopens.

Anything the incremental build cannot reproduce exactly (dependency locks,
packaging scripts, icons, unknown paths) needs the complete package build,
which also restarts the App.
