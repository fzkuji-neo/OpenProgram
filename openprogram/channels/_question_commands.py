"""Channel /answer · /decline text commands — answer a function's
runtime.ask / form question from a chat message.

A chat platform has no in-composer question card (that's the web UI). So
when a function pauses on runtime.ask inside a channel session, the
question is pushed to the chat (see _question_bridge) and the user
answers with a text command:

    /answer <qid> <choice…>     pick an option / type free text / a form value
    /decline <qid>              decline the question

Scope is the session, not an extra "owner" field: a question belongs to a
session_key, and `list_pending(session_key)` is what a /answer is allowed
to resolve. Discord and Slack scope each (channel, user) to its own
session (peer_id = "{chat_id}_{user_id}"), so users can't answer each
other's questions; a DM is one user; a Telegram group deliberately shares
one session (peer_id = chat_id, group-wide bot), so any member answering
is the group semantics, not a leak.

Each answer is submitted through the canonical execution wait command with
the channel actor and exact execution identity. The durable wait store keeps
the claim-once rule shared with the web UI.
