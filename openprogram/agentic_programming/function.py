agentic_function — decorator class that records function execution into the DAG.

Usage is identical to a decorator function:

    @agentic_function
    def observe(task): ...

    @agentic_function(expose="full", render_range={"callers": 1})
    def navigate(target): ...

Internally it's a class (like torch.no_grad), but users interact with it
as a decorator. The class form allows clean documentation and introspection.

class agentic_function:
    """
    Class decorator for functions whose body spawns an inner agent loop.

    Two roles per decorated function:

      1. **Python-direct-invoke**: ``research("topic")`` triggers
         ``__call__`` → runs the wrapper → executes the function body
         (which usually calls ``runtime.exec(...)`` to drive an inner
         LLM round). Used when another @agentic_function composes this
         one as a Python building block — no LLM round-trip on the
         outer side, just nested execution.

      2. **LLM tool dispatch**: every instance bridges itself into the
         shared ``openprogram.programs._runtime._registry`` via
         ``_register_as_tool`` (delegating to the same
         ``_build_and_register_tool`` helper ``@function`` uses). From
         the dispatcher's perspective the result is an ``AgentTool``
         indistinguishable from one produced by ``@function``, so all
         6 selection layers (``available_if`` / toolset / mode preset
         / ``check_fn`` / deny rules / ``defer``) apply uniformly.

    Both roles share one underlying ``self._wrapper`` that carries the
    DAG-recording semantics: on entry a placeholder code Call (status
    ``running``, ``output=None``) is appended to the GraphStore; on
    exit the same node is updated with the return value (or error)
    and timing. Set ``expose="hidden"`` to skip DAG recording.

    Args:
        expose:     What outside observers see of me after I complete. [DEFAULT: "io"]

                    "io"     — only name + return value (internals hidden)
                    "llm"    — only my LLM exchanges (my own name + return
                               value and my nested code sub-calls hidden)
                    "full"   — docstring + params + output + LLM reply + internals
                    "hidden" — no DAG node at all

                    ``expose`` is stamped into the code Call's metadata;
                    ``render_context`` uses it to decide whether a later
                    LLM call can see this function's internal nodes.

        render_range: What slice of the DAG I bring into my own LLM calls.

                    Dict stamped into the code Call's metadata; the
                    runtime's ``render_context`` reads it to bound the
                    history a nested ``runtime.exec`` sees.
                    Shape: {"callers": N, "subcalls": M}.

                    Effective default when omitted (``None``):
                      callers  = None  — uncapped pre-frame (the full
                                         conversation history that
                                         existed when this function
                                         started flows in)
                      subcalls = -1    — uncapped in-frame (the frame
                                         naturally sees its own
                                         progress: earlier runtime.exec
                                         results and returned sub-
                                         function io). Trimming a
                                         child @agentic_function's
                                         internals is done by the
                                         child's ``expose`` setting,
                                         not by subcalls counting.

                    Common patterns:
                      {"callers": 0}                  — isolated from
                                                        prior conversation
                      {"subcalls": 0}                 — wall off in-frame
                                                        (rarely needed)
                      {"subcalls": 3}                 — cap in-frame at
                                                        3 most recent
                                                        (loop budget)

        input:      UI metadata for function parameters (used by the visualizer
                    to render structured input forms).

                    Dict mapping parameter names to their UI config:
                    {
                        "text": {
                            "description": "The text to analyze",
                            "placeholder": "e.g. I love this product!",
                            "multiline": True,
                        },
                        "style": {
                            "description": "Output style",

                        },
                    }

                    Supported fields per parameter:
                      description  — short label shown next to the parameter name
                      placeholder  — example text shown in the input field
                      multiline    — True for textarea, False for single-line input
                      options      — list of allowed values (renders as dropdown)
                      hidden       — True to hide from the form (e.g. runtime)
                      advanced     — True for a user-settable field collapsed
                                     below the form's primary fields

                    Parameters not listed inherit defaults from the function
