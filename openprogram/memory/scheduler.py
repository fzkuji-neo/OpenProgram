"""Sleep scheduling — installs a daily background task in the worker.

The worker calls ``start_nightly_reorganizer(...)`` at boot. We spawn a
daemon thread that sleeps until the next 03:00 local time, reorganizes,
and loops. Lightweight; doesn't depend on a cron daemon.

Reorganizing rewrites topic files: splitting one that has grown to cover
several subjects, merging paragraphs that say the same thing, repairing
links. Writing only ever makes files longer, so without this a workspace
ends up as one enormous file per subject with its timeline cut to pieces
— the shape that makes ordering and counting questions unanswerable.
