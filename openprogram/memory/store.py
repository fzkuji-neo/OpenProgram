"""Where memory lives on disk.

The personal memory is the home project's workspace,
``<state>/projects/default/memory``; a project's own memory is
``<state>/projects/<project-id>/memory`` (see :mod:`.project_layer`).
Inside a workspace, ``topics/`` holds the memory and ``MEMORY.md`` at
the root is the entry point; its core section is rendered from
``topics/core.md``. Footnotes cite chat messages, which the session
store keeps, so a workspace holds no copy of any conversation.
