"""MemoryBackend abstract interface (Hermes-inspired).

The backend is the integration point between the memory subsystem and
the agent runtime. There is one shipped implementation,
``LocalMemoryBackend`` in ``local_backend.py``; the abstract class keeps
the door open for plugin backends (mem0, Honcho, Hindsight, ...) without
rewiring the agent.

The config key is ``memory.backend``, and this is the word for it
everywhere in the subsystem. "Provider" in this codebase means an LLM
vendor and nothing else.

The whole surface, and all of it but ``name`` has a default:

    name                                   — short identifier
    is_available()                         — can this one be activated
    initialize(session_id, **kwargs)       — once, before anything else
    shutdown()                             — once, after the last turn
    system_prompt()                        — static text for the system prompt
    search(query, *, session_id="")        — find context before each turn
    write(messages, *, session_id="", force=False)
                                           — fold conversation into memory
    extract_before_discard(messages)       — salvage text before compression
    reorganize(**kwargs) -> dict           — rewrite what has landed (nightly)

One verb per action, and the same verb in the implementation: the name
here is the name in ``local_backend.py``, so reading across the two
layers takes no translation. ``write`` is one method rather than a per-turn one
and a session-end one because the difference between the two is a single
flag — how hard to try — and every other word about them is the same.

Recalled memory has to reach the model inside a ``<memory-context>``
block with a system note, so old facts are read as background data
rather than as something the user just asked for. ``fence_memory``
builds that block, and the backend applies it: ``system_prompt`` and
``search`` return text that is already fenced. Nothing fences on the way
out — fencing twice strips the inner block and leaves an empty one, so
the wrapping happens once, where the text is produced.

        The two differ by ``force`` alone. Left False, the backend
        decides there is enough to be worth writing and usually does
        nothing — writing a paragraph per turn costs a model call per
        turn and produces memory shaped like a transcript. Set True at a
        session boundary, where there is no later batch to join, it
        writes the remainder however little of it there is.

        ``messages`` may be omitted, in which case the backend reads
        the conversation itself; the shipped one reads the durable
        session store, which is what lets a restart pick up where it
        left off. ``session_id`` names the conversation whose turns are
        being counted: the idle watcher walks many sessions in a loop
        and cannot rely on whichever one ``initialize`` last saw.

        Silence means success. Returning nothing — including forgetting
        to return at all — says nothing is owed and the caller marks the
        session handled. The opposite reading is what makes a missing
        ``return`` an endless retry.

        Return ``WriteFailure`` when turns are still unwritten:

        * ``retryable=True`` leaves the session unmarked, so the next
          poll offers it again.
        * ``retryable=False`` marks it handled anyway and reports the

          and a session retried forever burns model quota for nothing.
