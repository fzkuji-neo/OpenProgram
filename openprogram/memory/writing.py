"""Turn conversation into memory, once there is enough of it.

Folding turns into topic files costs a model call, so it waits until a
batch has gathered — roughly sixteen thousand tokens of conversation,
rather than a call per turn.

The conversation is read back from the session store rather than
accumulated in memory. That store is durable and ordered, the nodes
themselves record which memory workspace has written them, and it is what
every Topic footnote cites: memory keeps no copy of the conversation.
