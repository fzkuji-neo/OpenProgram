"""Session watcher — forces a memory write when a conversation goes idle.

Polls the session DB every ``poll_interval`` seconds. For any session
whose ``updated_at`` exceeds ``idle_minutes`` and which we haven't
already handled, hands the message list to the memory backend's
``write(..., force=True)``, which runs the writer over whatever the
per-turn path left behind.

State (already-processed session IDs and their last update timestamp)
lives at ``<state>/memory/<runtime-dir>/session-end.json`` so a worker
restart doesn't re-process every session. It goes in the runtime
directory rather than beside the memory: it changes on every poll, and
anything holding a workspace revision would read that as a concurrent
write.
