"""``MEMORY.md``: the entry point of a memory workspace.

It is the one file every session sees. Two parts:

- **The map** — what each part of the workspace holds, which subjects
  ``topics/`` covers, what has been active lately. The memory agents keep
  it; the Runtime only writes a first version for a workspace that has
  none, generated from the tree as it stands.
- **The core** — the facts and rules every session needs without asking:
  who the owner is, standing preferences. It is rendered from
  ``topics/core.md`` (the editable, evidence-carrying master) between
  ``CORE_START`` and ``CORE_END``, only from blocks whose evidence is
  trusted and within ``core_max_tokens``. The render replaces that section
  each time; anything outside it is the agents' own.

The prompt shows the map cut to ``GUIDE_MAX_BYTES``, then the core.

## Layout

- The core section at the end of this file — what every session needs, rendered from `topics/core.md`. Edit `topics/core.md`; the section is replaced on every write.
- `topics/` — the organised memory: one file per person, project or recurring theme. A subject with parts of its own is a directory with `overview.md` and one file per part. Paragraphs end in a `^block-id` and cite footnotes that point at the conversation they came from.
- `sources/` — the conversations themselves, archived verbatim and never edited. Follow a footnote here to check what was actually said.
- `timeline/` — the same facts by date: a file per year, with month and day files below it, for "what happened when".
- `relations.json`, `recent_events.jsonl` — links between paragraphs and the latest changes.

Search with `memory_search` first; read the Topic file a hit points to for the surrounding facts."""
