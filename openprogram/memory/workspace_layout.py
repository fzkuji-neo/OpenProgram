"""The names the runtime owns inside a memory workspace.

A workspace holds the memory — `core.md`, `topics/`, `sources/` and the
derived views — and beside it a small runtime area: cursors, the write lock,
staged backups, retrieval caches. A workspace kept under version control also
holds that tool's own directory. Neither is memory: both are hidden from
listings, left out of the revision, and never writable by a patch.

The runtime area is top level. A file inside `topics/` is authored memory
whatever it is called, so it lists and it counts toward the revision.

Workspaces built before the project took its current name carry the runtime
directory under its former name. They keep it: a stored run's hash covers
every byte of its workspace, so renaming a directory inside one would
invalidate the record it was published with. Anything opened for writing uses
whichever name that workspace already has, and a new workspace gets the
current one.
