"""A project's own Memory, read beside the personal one.

What a person prefers belongs everywhere they work; what one repository
decided belongs to that repository. With ``memory.layers.project`` on, a
conversation bound to a project reads two workspaces as one: the
project's, at ``<state>/projects/<project-id>/memory``, and the personal
one (the home project's). With ``memory.layers.project_writes`` also
on, what such a conversation records lands in the project's workspace
instead of the personal one. Both settings are on by default.

The project workspace is an ordinary memory workspace with its own git
history, index and runtime directory. ``store.root()`` hands it out for the
length of a ``use`` block, so every reader and writer that already asks
``store`` for its workspace works on it unchanged.

Access follows the execution's memory policy: an execution whose memory is
off reads no project memory either, and only one allowed to write memory
writes there.
