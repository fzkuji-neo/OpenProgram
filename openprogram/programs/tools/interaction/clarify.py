"""AskUserQuestion — the LLM's tool to ask the user question(s).

Mirrors Claude Code's ``AskUserQuestion``: one tool that asks 1–N
questions at once, each with a short header, 2–4 options (label +
description), single- or multi-select, plus free-text ("Other"). The
agent pauses until the user answers; the answers come back as a
structured dict the model reads.

It is a thin bridge over the unified ``runtime.ask`` user-input base
(``runtime.ask(questions=[...])``) — same ``question.asked`` event,
same composer popup card as ``runtime.ask`` from inside an
@agentic_function. The only difference is the entry point: here the
*model* drives it via tool-use; there *code* calls it directly.

Legacy: this used to be the single-question ``clarify`` tool. The
registry name is now ``ask_user_question``; ``clarify`` stays as an
alias function for any old caller.

DESCRIPTION = (
    "Ask the user question(s) and pause until they answer. "
    "USE SPARINGLY — prefer to infer intent and proceed with a sensible "
    "default rather than interrupting the user. Most of the time you "
    "should just act; mention your assumption in your reply instead of "
    "asking. Only ask when proceeding wrong would be costly or "
    "irreversible and you genuinely cannot decide from the request, the "
    "code, or context. "
    "When you must ask, keep it minimal and avoid forcing a pick from "
    "your options: the options you list are often not what the user "
    "wants, so phrase the question so a free-text answer is natural — "
    "the user can always type their own answer instead of choosing. "
    "Returns the user's response. Returns an error if no interactive "
    "frontend is available (e.g. a non-interactive batch job)."
