"""send_file — hand a file the agent has to the person it is talking to.

The tool does NOT deliver. It validates the path, reads its size, and
registers one marker in the turn's outbound list; the dispatcher folds
that list into the assistant message text, and each surface delivers it
its own way (web chat renders a chip that opens the file; a chat channel
uploads the bytes with the platform's own file API). The tool therefore
knows nothing about channels, and a new channel needs no change here.

Why a tool rather than a bare ``MEDIA:/path`` line in the reply prose
(openclaw / hermes) or an implicit scan for absolute paths (weclaw): the
failure mode of a prose convention is that an imperfect extraction leaks
the raw line to the user as text — a bill this repo has already paid
once, on inbound channel attachments. A tool call has somewhere to put
an honest "that file isn't there" and cannot be triggered by the model
merely mentioning a path.

SECURITY. This is the direction where a model names a path and the
system reads it out to a chat platform, so the path check is the whole
boundary — note in particular that ``openprogram/sandbox/`` does NOT
cover it: the sandbox wraps SHELL commands, and this tool is in-process
Python, so nothing else stands between a bad path and the wire. The
allowed set is :func:`openprogram.attachments.sendable_roots` — the
session's own workdir plus the project the session is explicitly bound
to — and symlinks are fully resolved BEFORE containment is tested, so a
link planted inside an allowed root cannot point outside it. A rejected
path returns a spelled-out error naming the roots; it never fails
silently.
