"""chat_send — post a message to the chat a channel conversation is in.

A turn that came in through Telegram, Discord, Slack or WeChat normally
answers with its final reply, which the channel layer posts. Two cases
need the agent to speak on its own:

* **Room events.** In a group set to ``/activation ambient``, a message
  that does not address the bot still reaches the agent, marked
  ``[room event]`` at the top. The final reply of such a turn stays in
  the transcript and is never posted; this tool is the only way the room
  hears from the agent, so staying quiet is the default.
* **A short note before long work** in an addressed turn ("checking,
  one moment"). The final reply still goes out afterwards.

The tool knows only the session id. Which chat to post to comes from the
turn the channel layer registered (:mod:`openprogram.channels._active_turns`),
never from the session row: a ``session_scope: main`` session holds
several chats.
