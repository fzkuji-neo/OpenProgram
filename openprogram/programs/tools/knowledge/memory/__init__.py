"""Memory functions — agent bundle for the Markdown memory workspace.

Functions exposed (all self-register via @function on import):

  memory_search — find paragraphs by meaning, or an exact string
  memory_get    — list what memory holds, read a file, section or block,
                  or read the chat message a footnote cites
  memory_update — correct or add records

Recording the conversation is not among them. That happens in the
background once enough has been said; see ``openprogram/memory``.
