"""agent — spawn another agent in the same session and return its reply.

Same-session multi-agent model: a turn is just
``(predecessor, prompt, agent_id)``. The new turn lands as a branch
in the parent session's DAG. Three start points:

  * ``start_from="clean"`` (default) — the spawned agent starts at a new
    root (``caller=null``), inside the same session repo. It sees
    only the prompt; the result becomes a peer DAG tree alongside
    the original conversation.
  * ``start_from="inherit"`` — the spawned agent forks off the caller's
    turn, inheriting the conversation that led up to it. Same DAG
    semantics as a "fork from here" click.
  * ``start_from="SID:MSG_ID"`` — the spawned agent forks off that exact
    node (any session), inheriting the chain up to it. This is how a
    new branch is forked from an arbitrary point in the DAG.

Returns the spawned agent's final text. The branch tip
(``session_id:head_id``) is recoverable from the chat history via
the attach indicator the caller writes afterwards (see
``run_agent_turn``).

The parent context — which session is active and which turn id is
running — is supplied via two ContextVars set by the dispatcher /
webui:

  * ``openprogram.agent.run_control._current_session_id`` —
    bound at ``execute_in_context`` entry.
  * ``openprogram.store._current_turn_id`` — set by
    ``dispatcher.process_user_turn`` to the assistant message id of
    the turn currently running.

If either is missing the tool returns an error string so the calling
LLM sees a clear message it can act on.

# Spawn budget: how many generations of NEW agents a chain may create.
# ONE level by default — the main agent spawns workers; a worker does
# the work itself. Even a single "coordinator" hop turned out to be an
# agent avoiding its job in practice (observed live: a weather query
# bounced through a whole delegation chain, every hop re-wording the
# same prompt). Deliberately tighter than the message budget
# (MAX_MESSAGES=8), which pays for multi-round conversation, not for
# creating agents. Module-level fallback for ``agent.max_spawn_depth``.
#
# Calibrated against the eight reference implementations (see
# docs/reference/design/runtime/agent-collab-comparison.html §05). Five
# of them cap generations at 1: openclaw, codex-cli V1, hermes-agent,
# opencode (by injecting a deny rule instead of counting) and us.
# Claude Code's 3 is the outlier and it does not transfer:
#
#   * its leaked source tree has no depth counter at all. `Agent` is
#     removed from every subagent's tool pool unless USER_TYPE=ant
#     (src/constants/tools.ts:36-46), so an external user's effective
#     depth there is 1. The depth-3 constant in the 2.1.226 binary
#     replaces that env gate; it loosens a hard 1, it does not extend
#     an already-working 3.
#   * background subagents are capped at 1 regardless of the counter:
#     the async tool allowlist (tools.ts:55-71) omits `Agent`, so an
#     agent spawned to run unattended can never spawn again. Depth 3
#     only ever applies to synchronous nesting, where the parent's tool
#     call blocks for the whole child run and a human is watching.
#     Our unattended path is `run_in_background=True`, so 1 is the
#     value Claude Code enforces on the path that matches ours.
#   * their per-level tool pool is rebuilt and `Agent` disappears at the
#     last level, which they pay for in prompt-cache misses. Ours is
#     deliberately binary (depth.delegation_budget_left), so a raised
#     limit would leave `agent` visible at every level and each extra
#     generation would cost a refused call instead of a smaller tool
#     list.
#
# Raise it when a spawned worker genuinely needs its own workers — a
# decomposition whose sub-parts are themselves multi-agent. 2 is the
# next sensible value; the refusal text tells the worker to do the work
# itself, so a chain that hits the limit still finishes.

# Fan-out budget: how many NEW agents ONE parent turn may create. The
# spawn budget above bounds the chain downward and the message budget
# bounds it sideways between existing agents, but neither counts
# siblings: a spawn hands the child one more generation and leaves the
# parent's own count untouched, so before this guard a single turn could
# call ``agent`` until the user stops the turn, i.e. unbounded
# nested agent runs from one runaway turn unless a caller cap is set.
#
# 8 comes from the two reference implementations that guard the same
# thing, read for what they actually count rather than for their number:
#
#   * openclaw caps live children per parent session at 5, range 1-20
#     (config/agent-limits.ts:5, enforced agents/subagent-spawn.ts:793).
#     That is the only true fan-out cap among the eight and it is a
#     spawn-time refusal, exactly like this one.
#   * hermes caps the task list of one ``delegate_task`` call at 3
#     (tools/delegate_tool.py:132) and separately truncates extra
#     ``delegate_task`` calls within one turn (run_agent.py:2344) —
#     that second guard is this one, aimed at the same runaway.
#   * pi-mono's 8 (examples/extensions/subagent/index.ts:27) caps one
#     call's task array and nothing else, so a parent there can still
#     spawn without bound over a conversation.
#
# hermes' 3 and pi-mono's 8 are batch-argument validation and do not
# transfer: ``agent`` creates one child per call, so a per-call cap
# would always read 1. openclaw's unit transfers, its number does not:
# it runs a pool of 8 against a per-parent cap of 5, we run 4
# (task.runner._DEFAULT_MAX_WORKERS) and background children queue on
# it, so a per-parent cap below the pool width would refuse fan-out
# that the pool is sized to absorb. 8 is two pool widths — a turn can
# fill the pool and keep one wave queued behind it, and the ninth spawn
# is refused with the existing agents' addresses so the model reuses
# them instead. It is also the most permissive of the three references,
# which is the right side to err on: this guard exists to stop a
# runaway, not to shape normal parallelism.
#
# Raise it for genuinely wide parallel work (one agent per file over a
# large set) and raise OPENPROGRAM_JOB_WORKERS with it, or the extra
# children only queue longer. 0 removes the limit.

    ``run_in_background=True`` returns immediately with an execution id;
    use the canonical execution resource and control surfaces.

    With ``to``: no agent is created — the task is dispatched to the
    named EXISTING branch and runs as its next turn. Always
    asynchronous: returns an execution id immediately (``run_in_background``
    is ignored); the result comes back automatically.

    Args:
        prompt: full instruction. In ``start_from="clean"`` this is ALL
            the spawned agent sees, so include any context it needs.
        description: short label (1-3 words) used as the branch name.
        agent_id: agent profile to run under. Defaults to this
            session's agent.
        start_from: ``"clean"`` (default) ⇒ the spawned agent starts at
            a new root with only the prompt visible. ``"inherit"`` ⇒
            forks off this turn and sees the full chain that led here.
            ``"SID:MSG_ID"`` ⇒ forks off that exact node. Mutually
            exclusive with ``to``.
        run_in_background: False (default) blocks for the final
            reply. True returns an execution id immediately for parallel
            execution; completion notifies the caller automatically.
            Ignored when ``to`` is set (always async).
        to: dispatch target — an existing branch, addressed as
            ``"SID:HEAD"`` or by branch name (see list_agents). A busy
            target queues the task and runs it when its turn ends.
        archive_when_done: True ⇒ archive the spawned branch once its
            task reaches terminal state (after the result flowed
            back): it disappears from list_agents and refuses further
            send_message / agent(to=) deliveries; its history stays
            readable and forkable. Default False keeps the agent
            addressable for follow-up questions. Spawn-only —
            incompatible with ``to``.
