"""Target ``app``: application windows, through ``openprogram/computer_use``.

The model reads an app with ``get_app_state`` (screenshot plus an indexed
Accessibility tree), acts by element index, screenshot pixel or a
description, and gets the changed part of the tree back after every action.
Everything happens in the background: the user's frontmost app, key window
and cursor are not touched. Approval is per application.
