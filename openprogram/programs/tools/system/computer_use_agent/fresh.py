"""``context="fresh"``: hand the task to a new agent that starts from a brief.

The new agent is an ordinary spawned agent (``agent(start_from="clean")``)
of this conversation's model and settings. It sees the brief, the target's
guide and nothing of the conversation; it works with ``computer_use_agent``
itself and only its final reply comes back.

Spawned turns cannot ask for approval, so the call carries its own: the
approval this call received for its app or VM is written as a conversation
rule for as long as the new agent runs, unless such a rule already exists.
