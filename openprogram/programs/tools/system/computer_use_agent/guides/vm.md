Guide: target "vm". Operate the remote virtual machine at the address set in Settings (computer_use.vm_url). It shows only pixels: there is no element tree, so every pointer action takes x,y in pixels of the last screenshot (or describe, where offered).

Each action below is written action(arguments). Send one as computer_use_agent(target="vm", action="click", args={"x": 640, "y": 360}), several as actions=[…] (up to 20; they stop at the first error). Every acting call returns a new screenshot.

Actions
- screenshot: the whole screen.
- click(x,y, mouse_button=left|right|middle, click_count=1..3).
- move(x,y): put the pointer there, for hover menus.
- drag(x, y, to_x, to_y).
- scroll(x?, y?, direction=up|down|left|right, clicks=5).
- type_text(text): types at the focus.
- press_key(key): one key or a chord in pyautogui names: "enter", "esc", "tab", "ctrl+c", "ctrl+shift+t".
- wait(duration=1): up to 10 seconds, then a screenshot.
