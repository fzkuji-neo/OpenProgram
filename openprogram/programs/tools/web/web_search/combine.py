"""Multi-provider aggregation strategies.

Borrowed concept from xynehq/websearch and pi-search-hub: instead of
picking ONE provider via priority + availability, run the query against
several backends concurrently and merge their ranked hit lists into one.

Implements two strategies:

  * **Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF)** — the canonical multi-source
    ranking blend. Each URL's final score is the sum of
    ``1 / (k + rank)`` across every provider that surfaced it. Common
    URLs ranked highly by multiple providers float to the top; one-off
    hits drop down naturally. ``k = 60`` is the value the original RRF
    paper recommends and what most search-aggregation projects use.

  * **Race** — return whichever provider's results come back first.
    Useful when latency matters more than coverage (one slow provider
    won't drag down a fast one).

The web_search tool exposes these via ``combine="rrf"`` / ``"race"``
and a ``providers=tavily,brave,exa`` arg.
