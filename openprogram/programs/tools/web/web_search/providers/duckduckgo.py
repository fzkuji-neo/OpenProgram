"""DuckDuckGo web search provider — zero-key fallback.

DDG has no official search API. We wrap the ``ddgs`` pip package (the
maintained successor to ``duckduckgo_search``) which scrapes their HTML
endpoint. The scrape is fragile — DDG has tweaked their HTML several
times over the years — so treat this as best-effort. Use it for a
demo or when you don't want to hand out API keys, but for serious agent
work set TAVILY_API_KEY or EXA_API_KEY.

The package is an *optional* dep: we do an import check inside
``is_available`` so a machine without ``ddgs`` installed doesn't crash
the registry, it just hides the DDG backend.
