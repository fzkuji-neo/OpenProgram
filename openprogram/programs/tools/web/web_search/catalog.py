"""Web-search provider metadata catalog.

Single source of truth for human-facing info about each backend:
description, pricing tier, where to sign up, link to OpenClaw setup
docs, and a 2-5 step "how to get this working" recipe. Consumed by:

  * ``openprogram/webui/routes/providers.py`` — surfaces the metadata
    over ``/api/search-providers/list`` so the React settings page can
    render a rich detail panel.
  * ``apps/cli/python/openprogram_cli/_impl/setup_sections/sections.py``
    (TUI picker) — prints
    ``setup_steps`` and ``signup_url`` after the user picks an
    unconfigured backend, so the CLI flow tells you where to go next
    without trying to handle key entry itself.
  * ``apps/web/public/js/shared/ui.js`` (legacy plus-menu) — pulls ``tier``
    into the Web Search chip tooltip ("Web Search · Brave · Free 2000
    q/mo").

Why a separate module:

  * The provider classes themselves only care about runtime config
    (env vars, endpoint URLs, HTTP transport). Stuffing freeform setup
    prose into each provider's docstring made it hard to surface
    consistently across three UI surfaces; centralising here means the
    UIs can iterate independently from the search runtime.
  * Entries can exist for providers that aren't registered yet
    (moonshot / kimi / ollama-search). UI shows them as "not
    configured" with a setup hint; flipping a switch later just means
    importing the corresponding module.

URLs are sourced verbatim from the OpenClaw docs at
``references/openclaw/docs/tools/{name}-search.md`` — do **not**
fabricate signup URLs; if the upstream doc didn't include one, leave
the field as ``None`` and the UI hides the row gracefully.
