"""list_mcp_resources — enumerate MCP resources across servers.

Resources are the protocol's read-only addressable items (files, API
results, snapshots). Servers list them by URI; the LLM picks one and
calls ``read_mcp_resource`` to pull contents.

Prompt text mirrors claude-code's ListMcpResourcesTool, lightly
adapted.

_DESCRIPTION = """List available resources from configured MCP servers.

Each returned resource is the standard MCP resource shape plus a `server` field naming which server it came from. Resources are read-only addressable items (think "files" the MCP server exposes) — fetch one via `read_mcp_resource(server=..., uri=...)`.

Parameters:
- server (optional): name of a specific MCP server. If omitted, queries every loaded server and returns the union.

Servers that don't support resources return nothing — they're skipped silently."""
