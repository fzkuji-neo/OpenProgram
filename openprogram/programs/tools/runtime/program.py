"""program tool — invoke any registered @agentic_function.

OpenProgram's programs (``@agentic_function``-decorated Python functions)
already know how to drive an LLM: they have their own system prompts,
their own context sculpting, and they can recursively spawn children.
Exposing the whole registry as a single tool lets an agent pick the
right sub-program by name rather than us hand-wiring each one as its
own tool.

Execution is synchronous — the tool blocks until the sub-program returns
its value, then hands the result back as a string. That's deliberate:

  * matches the usual tool-call mental model (agent asks, agent waits)
  * the runtime is auto-inherited via ``_current_runtime`` ContextVar,
    so the spawned program shares the same conv / provider / cache
  * cheaper than rolling a full async-task registry for a feature most
    sub-programs don't actually need

If a program takes 10 minutes we do block for 10 minutes. If you want
fire-and-forget, that's a future ``program_bg`` (not this tool).

Two call modes:

  1. ``list_only=True``    — return the catalogue. Useful so the agent
                             can discover what's available before calling.
  2. ``program="X"`` + args — actually run X with the given kwargs.
