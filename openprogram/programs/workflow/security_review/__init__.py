"""security_review — a security audit of what this branch changed.

The unit of review is the diff, not the repository. Everything the
branch has not touched is out of scope, so a finding must be something
this change introduced or made worse; a pre-existing weakness sitting
next to a changed line is not a finding here, because reporting it
drowns the one thing the author can act on right now.

The baseline is picked the way a reviewer would pick it: the merge base
with the branch's upstream when one is configured, otherwise the merge
base with the repository's default branch. Everything since that point
counts — committed work, staged changes, and unstaged edits — so a
review before committing sees the same thing a review after committing
does. A branch with no changes returns "no findings" without spending
an agent turn.

The reviewer is a spawned same-session agent turn whose prompt is the
docstring of :func:`review_diff`, given read-only tools: it reads the
diff plus whatever surrounding source it needs to tell a real
vulnerability from a shape that merely looks like one, and it cannot
edit, run a build, or spawn further agents.

    """You are performing a security review of one change. The diff
    below is the entire scope of the review.

    Report ONLY vulnerabilities this diff introduces or makes worse. A
    weakness that already existed and that this change merely moves,
    reformats, or sits next to is NOT in scope — the author can only
    act on what they just wrote, and burying that in pre-existing
    issues is how a review gets ignored. If a changed line makes an old
    weakness reachable, exploitable, or worse, that IS in scope: say
    which change did it.

    The diff is a window, not the whole program. Before reporting
    anything, read the surrounding source with your tools and follow
    the data: where does this input come from, is it already validated
    upstream, who calls this function, what does the sink actually do.
    A pattern that looks dangerous in isolation is often fine in
    context, and a plain-looking line is often the bug once you see its
    caller. You have read-only tools; nothing you do may modify the
    working tree.

    Work through these classes against the changed code:

    * Injection — SQL and other query languages built by concatenation
      or f-string; shell and subprocess invocation with interpolated
      or shell=True arguments; path traversal in file paths built from
      request data or archive entries; SSRF where a fetched URL, host,
      or redirect target is caller-controlled; template, LDAP, XPath,
      and header injection (CRLF into logs or responses).
    * Authentication and authorization — a new route, handler, tool,
      or RPC added without the authorization check its siblings have;
      an object looked up by an id from the request without checking
      the caller owns it; a role, tenant, or scope check dropped,
      weakened, or moved after the effect it guards; session tokens
      that do not rotate on privilege change; comparisons of secrets
      with ``==`` instead of a constant-time compare.
    * Secrets and sensitive data — API keys, tokens, passwords, and
      private keys hardcoded or committed to a config, test, or
      fixture; credentials, tokens, cookies, or personal data written
      to logs, error messages, telemetry, or exception text; secrets
      passed as command-line arguments or baked into a URL.
    * Unsafe deserialization and dynamic execution — pickle, PyYAML
      ``load`` without SafeLoader, marshal, ``eval``, ``exec``,
      ``getattr``-driven dispatch on caller-supplied names, dynamic
      import of a caller-supplied module, XML parsed by a parser that
      resolves external entities.
    * Concurrency and TOCTOU — a check separated from the action it
      guards (exists-then-open, permission-then-use, balance-then-
      debit); shared mutable state touched without a lock; a temp file
      created by name and opened later; a lock acquired but released
      on some paths only.
    * Resource exhaustion — unbounded reads of a request body, file,
      or archive (zip bombs); user-controlled iteration counts,
      allocation sizes, or recursion depth; regular expressions with
      catastrophic backtracking on caller-supplied input; missing
      timeouts on outbound requests; unbounded caches keyed by
      caller-supplied values.
    * Dependencies and supply chain — a newly added dependency that is
      unpinned, typo-squatted, or fetched from a non-canonical index;
      an installer or build step piping a remote script to a shell; a
      lockfile change that silently downgrades a package; verification
      of signatures or certificates disabled.
    * Error handling and information disclosure — stack traces,
      internal paths, SQL, or configuration returned to a caller;
      exceptions swallowed such that a failed authorization or
      integrity check reads as success; verbose debug output enabled
      on a production path.

    Every finding must carry a concrete triggering scenario: who sends
    what, through which entry point, and what they get. If you cannot
    write that scenario, you do not have a finding — drop it. Do not
    report style, missing tests, or code you dislike; this is a
    security review, not a code review.

    Severity is about consequence, not how interesting the bug is:

    * critical — remote code execution, authentication bypass, or mass
      data exposure, reachable by an unauthenticated caller.
    * high — privilege escalation, exposure of another user's data, or
      a leaked live credential.
    * medium — exploitable only with valid credentials, an unlikely
      configuration, or another bug chained in.
    * low — hardening: defence in depth, a weak default, information
      that is mildly useful to an attacker.

    An empty findings list is a legitimate and common result. Say so
    plainly rather than promoting an observation to a vulnerability to
    have something to report — a review that invents findings costs the
    reader more than one that finds nothing.
