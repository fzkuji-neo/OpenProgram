"""extract_pdf_tables — pull tables out of any PDF as Markdown.

Table layouts vary endlessly across publishers and templates: ruled
vs. borderless, single- vs. multi-column, captions above vs. below,
tables sharing a y-range with a neighbouring text column. Algorithmic
detection wins some and loses the next — every new template is a new
edge case.

So the geometry stays algorithmic only where it is *reliable* (the
``pdf_layout`` helper lays a page's words out at their real x/y positions
into fixed-width text) and the *judgement* — which rows are a table,
where it starts and ends, separating it from prose — is handed to the
LLM, page by page. The LLM reasons about whatever layout it sees
instead of matching a fixed template set.
