"""pdf_layout — faithful positioned-text rendering of PDF pages.

This module deliberately contains *no* table-detection heuristics.
Earlier attempts to algorithmically reconstruct tables (caption
anchoring, column gutters, row-gap cut-offs) worked for some layouts
and broke on the next one — every new paper template is a new edge
case.

The robust split of labour: do the part that is *reliable* here, and
leave the part that needs *judgement* to an LLM.

* Reliable, algorithmic — clustering a page's words into rows by their
  y-coordinate and laying them out at x-scaled positions into a
  fixed-width text block. The PDF text layer carries an exact bbox for
  every word, so this is lossless; columns end up visually aligned.

* Needs judgement — deciding which rows form a table, where a table
  starts and ends, separating a table from a neighbouring text column.
  That is what :mod:`openprogram.programs.workflow.document.extract_pdf_tables`
  hands to an LLM, which reasons about any layout instead of
  pattern-matching a fixed set of templates.

Public surface: :func:`page_layout`, :func:`render_page_png`,
:func:`pdf_pages`.
