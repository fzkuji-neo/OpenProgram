       - No author names, affiliations, or institutional info
       - No "our previous work..." or self-identifying references
       - No personal info in code links or supplementary
       - Check for hidden metadata

       - Title and abstract match submission system

    3. References:
       - All from Google Scholar (not DBLP or other sources)

       - No AI-generated fake references

    4. Figures & Tables:
       - All referenced in text ("Figure X", "Table Y")
       - Order matches first mention in text
       - Vector format (PDF/EPS) for figures, not PNG/JPG
       - Text in figures >= body text size
       - Booktabs style for tables

    5. Writing:
       - Last line of each paragraph has >= 4 words
       - Consistent terminology throughout
       - No absolute claims without hedging (use "generally", "often")
       - Proper label prefixes (sec:, fig:, tab:, equ:, alg:)

    6. Code submission:
       - Anonymous repository link
       - No personal info or hardcoded paths in code
       - No hidden files (.git) with author info
