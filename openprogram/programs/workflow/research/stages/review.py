    Evaluate the paper objectively: identify weaknesses AND acknowledge

    Review dimensions:
    - Community contribution: does this advance the field substantively?
    - Rigor: are claims supported by experiments? Fair baselines? Ablations?
    - Consistency: do intro claims match experimental validation?

    Distinguish fatal flaws from fixable issues — they carry different weight.
    Be specific: not "experiments insufficient" but "missing comparison with
    [specific method] on [specific dataset]".

    Score faithfully: if the paper is solid, give it a high score.
    Skip pleasantries, cut to core judgments.
