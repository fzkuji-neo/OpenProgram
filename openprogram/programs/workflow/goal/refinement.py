    """Translate the user's Goal into a concise completion SPECIFICATION.
    Preserve the requested outcome, constraints, scope and verification
    requirements. Every checklist item must be traceable to the user's
    request or a necessary correctness check for that outcome.

    Do not add requirements: no invented benchmark names, section counts,
    citation counts, figure counts, style ratios, word limits or quality
    comparisons. Preserve approximate constraints as approximate; do not
    turn "about 600 words" into an invented hard acceptance interval.
    Use as many checklist items as the task needs, including one for a
    simple task. Do not manufacture items to reach a minimum count.

    Inspect a reference only when the user provides one or explicitly
    asks for comparison against one. Apply only its relevant requested
    aspects, not every property of that reference. Do not search for a
    reference merely to impose additional acceptance criteria.

    Name the evidence needed to check each requested outcome. If the
    user requires verified external sources, require actual source
    inspection; model memory or a writer's claim of verification is not
    a substitute. Missing access remains an unresolved verification
    requirement, not permission to lower the acceptance standard.

    Preserve explicit exclusions. Record material ambiguities in the
    specification as unresolved questions, not guessed requirements;
    the Goal's asynchronous question mechanism handles them. Keep
    ordinary implementation choices separate from acceptance criteria.
    Do not perform the task or modify files during refinement.

    Write the specification and checklist in the SAME LANGUAGE as the
    Goal. Keep both concise and faithful to the user's original request.

    End your reply with STRICT JSON only, no markdown fence, no prose
    after it:
    {"spec": "<the full specification as one string>",
     "checklist": ["<verifiable item>", "<verifiable item>", …]}
