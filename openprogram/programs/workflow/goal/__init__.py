"""Persistent chat Goals and the compatible Python Goal Workflow.

Interactive ``/goal`` and Goal controls save objective state and execute normal
chat turns. ``chat`` integrates admission, terminal accounting and continuation;
``chat_tools`` exposes short create/get/update operations. Existing todo items
can carry the Goal identity and revision. Completion candidates are checked by
an independent, read-only ordinary chat turn in ``verification``.

Programs and Python may still call :func:`goal` with isolated pre-call context.
That compatibility Workflow owns its refinement, work rounds and judgment.

Evaluation is one decision agent turn: :func:`judge_goal` (prompt in
its docstring) reads the session's compacted context view plus the
goal text and answers strict JSON with a typed verdict, reason, optional
question, independent-work flag, options, and checklist. Only its ``met`` counts
as completion. Deterministic responsibilities are split as

* ``goal``: public :func:`goal` entry
* ``command``: ``/goal`` parsing plus status and mutation actions
* ``judge``: :func:`judge_goal` and :func:`evaluate_goal`
* ``refinement``: the one refinement operation used by :func:`goal`
* ``loop``: deterministic transitions and next-round instructions
* ``state``: goal meta read / write, stop-rule constants, event fan-out
* ``notices``: transcript system rows, terminal finisher

The legacy ``judge`` implementation belongs only to the Python Workflow.
Design doc:
docs/reference/design/runtime/goal-framework-implementation-comparison.html.

Goal state is one versioned session snapshot. It contains the objective and
refined checklist, typed lifecycle status, controller checkpoint, cumulative
budgets and usage, an ordered question queue, and answers waiting for the next
controller boundary. ``goal_id`` is stable across resume; each execution has a
new ``run_id``. See the design document for the complete schema and states.

Tests monkeypatch functions ON THIS PACKAGE (``monkeypatch.setattr(G,
"evaluate_goal", ...)`` with ``G = openprogram.programs.workflow.goal``); the
submodules therefore call each other through the package object, and
these re-exports are the single authoritative binding every internal
call site resolves against.
