"""Persistent chat Goals.

Interactive ``/goal`` and Goal controls save objective state and execute normal
chat turns. ``chat`` integrates admission, terminal accounting and continuation;
``chat_tools`` exposes short create/get/update operations. Existing todo items
can carry the Goal identity and revision. Completion candidates are checked by
an independent, read-only ordinary chat turn in ``verification``.

* ``goal``: the Programs form entry that starts a chat Goal
* ``command``: ``/goal`` parsing plus status and mutation actions
* ``state``: goal meta read / write, budgets, event fan-out
* ``execution``: canonical execution state and action eligibility
* ``notices``: transcript system rows

Design doc: docs/reference/design/runtime/goal-and-recovery.html.

Goal state is one versioned session snapshot: the objective, typed lifecycle
status, optional token / active-time / cost limits and cumulative usage.
``goal_id`` is stable across resume; each resume starts a new ``run_id``.

Tests monkeypatch functions ON THIS PACKAGE (``monkeypatch.setattr(G,
"load_goal", ...)`` with ``G = openprogram.programs.workflow.goal``); the
submodules therefore call each other through the package object, and
these re-exports are the single authoritative binding every internal
call site resolves against.
