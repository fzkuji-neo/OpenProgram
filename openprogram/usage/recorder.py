"""UsageRecorder — turns a finished LLM call into a UsageEvent and appends
it to the ledger.

This is the single place that knows how to assemble an event from the
three inputs available at the stream.py chokepoint: the ``Model`` (carries
pricing), the final ``AssistantMessage`` (carries provider-reported
``Usage``), and the current ``UsageContext`` (carries the call source).

Legacy record_message and publish hooks are best-effort. Event construction
is strict for callers that durably settle a budget or Goal request receipt.
