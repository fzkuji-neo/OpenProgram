"""Per-session send_message inbox — queueing for busy targets.

When ``send_message(to="SID:HEAD")`` addresses a branch whose session is
mid-turn (``run_control.is_turn_running``), delivering immediately would
race the running turn for the same head. Instead the message is persisted
here — ``<session-repo>/inbox.json``, same placement pattern as
``jobs.json`` (agent/job/store.py) — and the dispatcher drains the
inbox at turn end (``_process_turn_once``), re-delivering each entry
through the normal async delivery path so the usual auto-followup returns
the reply to the sender.

Delivery-then-delete: an entry is removed only after its delivery turn
was successfully submitted. A crash between the two may re-deliver a
message (acceptable); the reverse order could silently lose one (not
acceptable).

Limits (mirroring Claude Code cross-session messaging):
  * at most ``MAX_PENDING`` (50) entries per target session — a full
    inbox drops the oldest entry and leaves a system notice in the
    dropped message's sender session;
  * an identical message from the same sender session within
    ``DEDUP_WINDOW_SECS`` (60s) of a still-queued copy is rejected as a
    duplicate.

# Inbox depth. 50 is Claude Code's number for the same thing: its
# cross-session mailbox is a 50-entry ring that drops the oldest
# (2.1.226 binary @253677687), and it is the only reference
# implementation with a queue to compare against — openclaw and
# codex-cli deliver into a running thread instead of a mailbox, and the
# other five have no inbox at all. Raise it if a session is legitimately
# addressed by more than 50 senders while one turn runs; the overflow
# notice in the dropped sender's session tells you when that happens.
MAX_PENDING = 50

# Duplicate window. The check only fires against entries that are STILL
# QUEUED, so this bounds one thing: how long a sender has to wait before
# the same text counts as a deliberate resend rather than a retry loop.
# A model that retries because it got no answer retries inside the same
# turn, seconds apart, so 60s covers the loop with room to spare while
# leaving a genuine "I asked five minutes ago, asking again" through.
# No reference implementation has a content-plus-time duplicate check to
# copy: Claude Code dedups by message uuid and weclaw by inbound message
# id for 5 minutes, both of which only catch a byte-identical
# retransmission of the same message object, never a model that composed
# the same text twice. Shorten it if deliberate resends are being
# refused; lengthen it if retry loops get through.
