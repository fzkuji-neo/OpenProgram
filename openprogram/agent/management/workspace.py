"""Retire the per-agent workspace persona files.

Agents used to carry ``<state>/agents/<id>/workspace/`` with AGENTS.md,
SOUL.md, USER.md and TOOLS.md seeded from templates. Instructions now come
from AGENTS.md files layered by directory (``openprogram.context.agents_md``)
and an agent's own instructions are its ``system_prompt`` setting, so these
files are no longer read.

:func:`retire` runs once per agent at worker startup:

- a file still equal to the template it was seeded with is deleted;
- a file someone edited is appended to the agent's ``system_prompt`` under a
  heading naming it, then moved to ``workspace/.retired/`` so nothing is lost;
- the ``workspace`` directory is removed when that leaves it empty.

## Operating rules
- Answer concisely by default. Expand only when asked or when the
  answer needs justification.
- When the user gives a task, do the task — don't ask clarifying
  questions unless the input is genuinely ambiguous.
- When you change a file or run a command, say what you did and why
  in one sentence, not a narrative.

## Tools
- All tools are read-only unless told otherwise.
- Ask before taking destructive actions (delete, force-push, send
  external messages).
