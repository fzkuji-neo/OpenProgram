"""Job entity + state machine.

The entity is plain data — no runtime objects (cancel_event, future)
stored on it. Those live in the runner's parallel maps so the row
serialises cleanly to ``jobs.json`` and can be round-tripped through
crash recovery.

State transitions per ``docs/design/runtime/async-job-lifecycle.md`` D2:

  pending → queued → running → completed
                            ↘ cancelled
                            ↘ errored

  pending → cancelled / errored  (user stopped before pickup, or
                                  runner shutdown)
  queued  → cancelled / errored
  running → completed / cancelled / errored

Terminal states (``completed`` / ``cancelled`` / ``errored``) are
absorbing — no further transitions allowed.
