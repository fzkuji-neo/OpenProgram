"""Default chat-runtime workdir resolution.

Single seam between the session store (which owns ``workdir/`` inside
each session's git repo) and the runtime (which forwards a working
directory to subprocess-spawning providers via ``--cd`` and similar).

Why a tiny helper and not inline in execute_in_context: keeps the
fallback chain in one place when the override sites multiply (right
now /api/run sets its own work_dir; future sub-agent dispatch will
want to point a fresh runtime at a sub-agent's worktree).
