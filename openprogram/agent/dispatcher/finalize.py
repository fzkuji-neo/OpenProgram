"""Turn finalization — phase 6 bookkeeping.

Extracted from dispatcher/__init__.py (dispatcher-split step 4). After the
assistant message is persisted, ``finalize_turn`` runs the best-effort
turn-end bookkeeping, each sub-step independently guarded so a failure
never breaks the turn:

  6.   session head_id / last_prompt_tokens / model
  6.1  context-commit backfill (assistant output + tool sub-calls)
  6.4  feed real provider usage back into the context engine
  6.5  auto-title on the first text turn
  6.8  git-commit the turn (git-as-truth)
  6.9  project auto-commit (entity layer)
  6.95 evict old per-turn file-backup snapshots

Designed to take the resolved agent profile + context window as explicit
args (``agent_profile`` / ``ctx_win``), which the dispatcher resolves
under its test-patch seam and hands down — so this module never calls a
test-patched helper (_load_agent_profile / _resolve_model). It depends
only on ``titles._maybe_auto_title`` at module scope; everything heavy is
pulled in via in-function local imports. See
docs/design/runtime/dispatcher-split.md.
