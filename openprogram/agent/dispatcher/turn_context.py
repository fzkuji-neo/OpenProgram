"""Turn-scoped context bindings — pipeline step 3 (dispatcher-split).

Attach a Runtime with the session's GraphStore so any @agentic_function
the agent_loop invokes records its placeholder / internal / exit nodes
into the same DAG. The Runtime is shared via the ``_current_runtime``
ContextVar that @agentic_function's _inject_runtime consults.

``TurnBindings.bind`` sets every per-turn ContextVar (session id, turn
id, worktree cwd, GraphStore, DAG runtime), installs the session-scoped
deferred-tool set and optionally snapshots the project auto-commit baseline.
``release`` resets the tokens — the caller runs it in a ``finally`` so
success, exception and early-return paths all unwind identically.
