"""Forced tool-call dispatch — run a single @agentic_function without
invoking the LLM.

Extracted from dispatcher/__init__.py (dispatcher-split step 2). This is
a leaf: it shares the runtime-block placeholder/finalize plumbing with an
LLM-issued tool call, but pulls everything it needs through in-function
local imports, so it depends only on the stdlib + ``types`` here. The
package ``__init__`` re-exports ``dispatch_forced_tool_call`` so
``from openprogram.agent.dispatcher import dispatch_forced_tool_call``
(webui/routes/chat.py) resolves unchanged.

See docs/design/runtime/dispatcher-split.md.
