"""Turn-dispatch type definitions — aliases, the parent sentinel, the
TurnRequest / TurnResult dataclasses, and the no-op ``EventCallback``
default (``_noop``).

Extracted from dispatcher/__init__.py (dispatcher-split step 1). These
depend only on the stdlib, so they live in a leaf module
that everything else (and external callers) can import without pulling in
the heavy agent-loop / provider chain. ``__init__`` re-exports every name
here, so ``dispatcher.TurnRequest`` and
``from openprogram.agent.dispatcher import TurnRequest`` resolve unchanged.
