"""Turn preparation — pipeline steps 1-2 (dispatcher-split).

Step 1: ensure the session row exists and resolve the LLM history for
this turn (history_override / INHERIT_PARENT branch walk / explicit
branch_from fork). Step 2: resolve the user node's predecessor, recall
the memory prefetch, build the user_msg dict, seed the ROOT node and
persist the user message through the TurnWriter.

Called once per turn by ``_process_turn_once`` in ``__init__.py``;
returns the (session, history) pair the rest of the pipeline consumes.
