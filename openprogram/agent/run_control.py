"""
Run control for turn execution: cancel / session binding /
active-runtime registry.

This is turn-execution state, not a UI concern — the web UI, the job
runner, channels, process runners and long-running tools all steer the
same machine. Importing this module claims the core's host-integration
seams (``set_cancellation_check`` / ``set_session_id_provider``), which
is what makes the exec loop cancellable; ``agentic_programming`` itself
never imports this layer and keeps its headless defaults when nobody
does.
