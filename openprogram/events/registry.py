"""Central event registry — the admission boundary of the event layer.

``EVENTS`` lists every event type the bus recognizes. An event type enters
this registry only when a real consumer subscribes to it (the same
principle ``bridges.py`` applies to type-B sources — a moment becomes an
event because someone wants to respond to it, never because the code
happens to pass through it). Emitting an unregistered type is tolerated
during migration — the bus logs one warning per type instead of raising.

Two kinds of dispatch:

* ``notify`` — asynchronous observation via ``EventBus.emit``; subscribers
  can never block or influence the emitter.
* ``gate`` — synchronous veto via ``EventBus.emit_gate``; subscribers run
  in the emitter's thread and any deny reason stops the action.
