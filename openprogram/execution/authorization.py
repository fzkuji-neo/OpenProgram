"""Execution-scoped authorization with non-disclosing denials.

The transport authenticates an actor; this module resolves the exact
execution, project and session boundary before an execution read or action is
allowed.  It deliberately returns one ``not_found`` result for unknown and
unauthorized targets so a caller cannot enumerate executions.
