"""A single end-to-end wall-clock deadline, carried via a ContextVar.

The problem this solves: ``runtime.exec(timeout_s=...)`` only bounds its
OWN retry loop, and only between attempts. The provider's inner stream
retry loop (``stream_retry.retry_stream``) and the codex SSE parser run
on their own count/budget, completely blind to the caller's deadline. A
persistent transport error therefore multiplies the two loops
(``max_attempts`` × ``max_retries``) with nothing capping the total
wall-clock. See ``docs/design/providers/reliability/error-and-timeout-mechanism.html``.

Rather than thread a ``timeout`` argument through every layer (which
would break the ``_call(content, model, response_format)`` override
contract every provider implements), we publish a single **absolute
monotonic deadline** in a ContextVar — the same pattern ``runtime`` already
uses for ``_current_tools`` / ``_current_tool_policy``. ``exec`` sets it
once around its retry loop; the inner stream-retry loop and the SSE
parser read it and refuse to start a new attempt / sleep / block past it.

This module has ZERO imports beyond stdlib so both ``runtime`` (high
level) and ``providers.utils.stream_retry`` / the codex provider (low
level) can import it without an import cycle.

ContextVar propagation notes:
  * ``asyncio.run(coro)`` copies the *current* context into the Task it
    creates, so a deadline set on the calling (sync) frame reaches the
    async provider code. (``runtime._run_async`` additionally forwards the
    context when it has to offload to a worker thread.)
  * ``set_deadline`` returns a token; pass it to ``reset_deadline`` in a
    ``finally``. Nesting is safe (token-based), so an inner ``exec`` with a
    smaller remaining budget restores the outer deadline on exit.
