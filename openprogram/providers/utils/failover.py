"""Provider/model failover classification.

Decides whether an LLM-call failure is worth retrying on a *different*
provider/model (rather than the same one). Mirrors OpenClaw's
``failover-matches.ts`` and hermes' fallback chain: transient capacity /
availability problems (rate limit, overload, server error, timeout,
network) are failover-worthy; request-level problems (auth, invalid
request, context overflow, content policy) would fail on any provider, so
they are not.

``failover_category`` / ``should_failover`` are a PURE classifier — they
have no opinion on *which* fallback to use. The runtime fallback chain
(:func:`resolve_fallback_models` and below) layers on top.
