"""Stream-level retry orchestration shared by every HTTP-based provider.

Each provider's ``_run()`` performs roughly the same dance: open an
``httpx`` stream, read SSE events, push them to ``EventStream`` until
``[DONE]``. Until the consumer has seen real data, a transport hiccup
(connection reset, 502, idle timeout) is recoverable — we can throw
away the half-open stream and re-send the identical request. The
moment any ``content`` block has been pushed to the ``EventStream``,
recovery requires either Last-Event-ID resumption (which neither the
OpenAI nor Anthropic Responses API expose) or a "discard partial,
resend" decision that crosses provider semantics.

This module factors the retry logic out so every provider gets:

  * ``retry_stream(attempt_fn, is_committed_fn, ...)`` — the
    orchestrator. Calls ``attempt_fn`` up to ``max_attempts`` times,
    classifies failures, honors ``Retry-After`` as a lower bound,
    and re-raises the last exception (which the provider should wrap
    via ``ev_stream.fail()`` so ``runtime.exec()`` catches via
    :func:`_build_llm_error` → :class:`LLMError`).
  * ``ProviderStreamError`` — exception type carrying the metadata
    ``runtime.exec()`` needs to classify (http_status, retry_after_s,
    retryable, error_text, provider).
  * ``is_retryable_status`` / ``stream_backoff_seconds`` /
    ``read_retry_after`` — building blocks providers can also call
    directly when they want custom retry shapes.

Defaults:

  * Max attempts: ``OPENPROGRAM_PROVIDER_STREAM_RETRIES`` env, default 3
  * Backoff base: 1.0s, doubled per attempt, ±25% jitter
  * Retry-After honored as lower bound with positive-only jitter
    (OpenClaw pattern: see ``references/openclaw/src/infra/retry.ts``)

The 5-min SSE idle timeout and 30-min total ceiling are provider-side
constants (each provider sets its own via ``OPENPROGRAM_SSE_IDLE_TIMEOUT_S``
/ ``OPENPROGRAM_SSE_TOTAL_TIMEOUT_S``); this module classifies them
when they bubble up but doesn't enforce them.
