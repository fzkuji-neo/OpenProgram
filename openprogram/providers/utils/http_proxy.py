"""Proxy configuration diagnostics for explicit policy-proxy setup.

Resolution order (design record: docs/reference/design/providers/network-proxy.md):

1. ``OPENPROGRAM_PROXY_URL`` — explicit first-party override. All traffic
   routes through it (``http://``, ``https://`` or ``socks5://``);
   ``NO_PROXY`` bypasses still apply.
2. Standard environment variables, parsed by httpx's own
   ``get_environment_proxies()`` — ``http(s)_proxy`` / ``all_proxy`` /
   ``no_proxy`` in both cases, lowercase winning. Reusing httpx's parser
   (instead of a reimplementation) keeps the hardened clients byte-for-byte
   consistent with every plain ``httpx.AsyncClient()`` and SDK-built client
   in the process.

Managed provider clients do not consume this mount map: direct ``httpx``
mounts cannot enforce the peer checks required by Runtime URL policy.  The
remaining rescue command uses this helper only to report configured proxy
state.  An enforcing proxy must instead be declared through
``OutboundSecurityConfig.policy_proxy``.
