"""Budget enforcement for one provider request.

``stream()`` / ``stream_simple()`` are the single seam every LLM call this
module serves passes through, so reserve/start/settle lives here rather than
in each adapter.

A call is *budgeted* only when a governed job is bound to this context
(``current_job_resource_context()``). Everything else — CLI, tests, headless
usage — stays on the historical best-effort recording path untouched.

The order matters and is the whole point of the module:

1. estimate a conservative input upper bound and reserve token/cost exposure
   BEFORE credentials are resolved or any socket is opened;
2. clamp ``max_tokens`` to the reserved output cap so the provider cannot
   return more than was paid for;
3. mark the reservation started immediately before provider I/O;
4. settle the real provider-reported usage atomically with appending the
   UsageEvent, releasing only the unused exposure.
