"""Persistence layer for provider / model configuration.

All reads and writes against ``~/.openprogram/config.json``'s ``providers``
sub-tree, plus the small helpers that resolve per-provider API keys and
base URLs from the same store. Config IO delegates to the canonical
reader/writer in ``openprogram.setup`` (one read policy, one 0o600 write
path); the raw migration-free section read lives in ``_config_read`` —
the registry loader uses that one so a reload never re-enters the spec
migration below.

The interesting domain logic lives here:

* the full-spec model rows under ``providers.<p>.models`` — the single
  source of truth the runtime registry loads — with
  ``_normalize_spec_row`` as the one choke point that stamps the
  Model-schema keys onto every persisted row;

* the one-time migration of legacy ``enabled_models``/``custom_models``
  configs into spec rows;

* custom (user-added) provider CRUD and per-provider config
  (base-URL override, manual model rows);

* ``_resolve_base_url`` — the layered base-URL resolution the fetchers
  and connectivity probes share.

The module-level ``_cache_lock`` serialises all read-modify-write
sequences. Same lock the legacy monolith used; sharing one process-
wide lock is fine because the config file is tiny.
