"""Rewrite arbitrary JSON Schema for OpenAI strict mode compatibility.

OpenAI's structured-outputs / strict-mode validation is a constrained
subset of JSON Schema:

  * Every ``object`` schema MUST set ``additionalProperties: false``.
  * Every property declared under an object MUST appear in the
    ``required`` list. Optional fields are expressed by making the
    type a union with ``"null"`` instead of omitting from ``required``.
  * A handful of JSON Schema keywords are not supported and silently
    rejected on the server: ``pattern``, ``format``, ``minLength``,
    ``maxLength``, ``minimum``, ``maximum``, ``multipleOf``, ``minItems``,
    ``maxItems``, ``uniqueItems``, ``default``, ``contentEncoding``,
    ``contentMediaType``, ``examples``, ``$ref`` (in the function-tool
    flavour). Leaving them in a tool definition gets the whole
    completion rejected with 400.

  * Optional ``enum`` works fine and is honoured by constrained decoding
    — the LLM literally cannot emit a value outside the enum.

  * Top-level schema MUST be an ``object``.

This module's ``fixup_for_strict()`` takes a copy of any schema and
applies the rewrites in-place on the copy so the original tool
definition (used by other providers + the docs / catalog) is untouched.

    """Return a deep copy of ``schema`` rewritten for OpenAI strict mode.

    Three rewrites applied recursively to every nested ``object``:

      1. Force ``additionalProperties: false``.
      2. Make every property that isn't already required appear as
         "required + nullable" (``type: [<old>, "null"]``). Strict
         doesn't allow partial-required; we preserve "this field is
         optional" semantics by letting the LLM emit null.
      3. Strip unsupported JSON Schema keywords from the property
         descriptors.

    Top-level non-object schemas (e.g. a tool that takes a string
    argument directly — unusual, but seen in some hand-rolled specs)
    are wrapped in a ``{ type: object, properties: {...} }`` envelope
    so OpenAI's "top-level must be object" rule is met. We don't ship
    any tools that need this today, but the wrap keeps us safe.

    Behaviour is idempotent: calling ``fixup_for_strict`` on an
    already-strict schema is a no-op modulo deep-copy cost.
