"""The two never-writable paths, resolved without importing anything heavy.

The sandbox used to reach into ``openprogram.programs`` for these, which
dragged the whole tool registry into every policy construction — one
unrelated tool failing to import took the sandbox down with it. Both paths
only depend on where the ``openprogram`` package sits and on ``paths``, so
they live here and both sides import this instead.
