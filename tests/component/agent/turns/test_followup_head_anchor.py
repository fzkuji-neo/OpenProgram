"""Follow-up notifications anchor at HEAD and advance it, in series.

Two sub-agents finishing used to produce two notification turns both
anchored at the node that spawned them — parallel siblings, so one user
message got answered twice. The runner now leaves ``branch_from`` at
``INHERIT_PARENT`` (the dispatcher resolves it to the session's current
HEAD) and serialises follow-ups per delivery session.

See docs/reference/design/runtime/dag/overview.md §4.
