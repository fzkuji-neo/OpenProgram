"""Embedding contract: the DAG-context function-calling core must work as a
plain library inside somebody else's stack.

The scenario under test is importing OpenProgram from a source-development
environment: the host app brings its own LLM client, picks
its own directory for session state, and never starts the webui / TUI / CLI.

Three properties are pinned here, each of which has broken before:

  1. importing the public surface must not drag in a server framework
     (fastapi / uvicorn / textual) — those are optional extras, absent in a
     library install, so an eager import would be an ImportError at the door;
  2. persistence must be reachable through an explicit directory, never via
     ``openprogram.paths`` — an embedded host must not get a ``~/.openprogram``
     written behind its back. Enforced by patching the paths accessors to
     raise, so any implicit call fails loudly instead of silently creating it;
  3. no-store mode must still execute — ``_store`` unset means "run, persist
     nothing", which is what a host that keeps its own trace wants.
