"""Bridge: run the desktop-side node check harnesses as part of pytest.

Both scripts are real harnesses, but nothing used to run them — so
check-webtab-navigation.js sat broken on a clean checkout for a long time
without anyone noticing. Running them here (and from `npm run check` in
apps/desktop/package.json) means they fail loudly instead of rotting.
