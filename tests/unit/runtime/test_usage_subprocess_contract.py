"""Phase 3 metering — subprocess UsageContext propagation contract.

spawn doesn't copy contextvars, so process_runner must (a) snapshot the
parent context and (b) pass it positionally to _child_entry, which restores
it via apply_snapshot. mp.Process passes args POSITIONALLY, so a reorder
would silently feed the snapshot into the wrong slot — these tests pin the
parameter name/position and the restore behaviour."""
