"""The background writer's silent-loss paths.

Turns are handed to the writer and marked only after they reach a topic
file. Every failure on this path must therefore leave the source nodes
unmarked so a later pass can offer them again.

Four of them lived here at once. The session store stamps Unix seconds
and the memory layer parses ISO 8601, so every write raised before it
reached a model. The idle write took one batch and reported the session
finished. A write that raised was reported to the watcher as success. A
repair commit that was rejected a second time was reported as ``ok``.

The fifth is the opposite failure, and it costs money rather than
turns: a session nothing will ever write was retried on every poll.
So the outcome ``write`` hands back says both whether the session is
written and whether coming back could change that.

No model is called: the writer, the token counter and the organiser are
all replaced, and what would have been sent to the model is captured
instead.
