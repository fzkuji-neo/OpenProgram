"""A memory writer hears about a broken rule on the edit that broke it.

The Write and Edit tools run the commit's checks on a copy of the stage after
each change to a Topic file, so the writer can fix it before the turn ends and
the whole turn is discarded. Mechanical slips are repaired rather than
reported, and every format error names the file it is in.
