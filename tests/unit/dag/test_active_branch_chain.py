"""Regression guard: the web chat view must show ONLY the active branch.

The bug: ``handle_load_session`` built the displayed chat list from
``all_msgs`` (every node in the DAG, all branches) and then tried to
*widen* it toward the active branch with a ROOT-prepend gap-fill. That
gap-fill used "ROOT-parented + timestamp earlier than the current
chain" as its heuristic, which cannot tell a genuinely-missing earlier
turn of THIS branch apart from the root of a DIFFERENT sibling branch —
so forked/retried sessions leaked other branches' turns into the chat.

``active_branch_chain`` fixes it by making the active-branch node-id set
(from ``get_branch(head)``) authoritative: keep only ``all_msgs`` rows
whose id is on the active branch, in seq order, with tool_calls already
folded into their parent assistant. These tests pin that contract using
the exact message shapes seen in real branched sessions.
