"""Unit tests for WS attachment handling — caps, filename safety, kind
classification, and the model-facing head preview.

These helpers in ``openprogram/webui/ws_actions/chat.py`` are reachable directly
from user input (uploads / @-mentions) and commit blobs to a git workdir, so a
cap bypass or misclassification is a storage/DoS vector. They are pure (no IO),
so they're tested directly.
