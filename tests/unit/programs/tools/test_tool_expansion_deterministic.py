"""Tool expansion must be DETERMINISTIC — the tools array sits at the prompt
cache prefix root (providers/cache_policy.py), so if the same intent expands
to a different order/set across turns, the whole prompt cache misses every
turn (silently, no error). These tests lock the property: same intent →
byte-identical tool name sequence.

Design: docs/design/runtime/tool-toggle-management.md §4.2 (hard constraint),
§6 step 1.
