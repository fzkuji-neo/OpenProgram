"""Named presets must name tools that exist.

Resolution drops a name the registry does not know, silently — a preset is a
wish list, not a declaration. So a tool that is renamed leaves every preset
that listed it quietly handing out less than it says, with nothing to notice
it: ``toolset="memory"`` spent a while offering three of the six memory
tools because it still listed the names of a previous memory layer.
