"""Self-recursion guard for @agentic_function (regression test).

An agentic harness (e.g. ``wiki_agent``) runs an inner agent loop via
``runtime.exec()`` with the FULL toolset, and the FULL toolset is every
exposed tool, harness entry points included (gui_agent /
research_agent / wiki_agent). The inner
model could in principle call ``wiki_agent`` from inside ``wiki_agent``
→ unbounded nesting (the "7-layer nesting" root cause).

The guard is now two-layer (the old tool-policy *deny* that hid the
function from its own toolset was removed):

  1. Primary — situational steering: a prompt prefix injected by
     ``runtime._situational_prefix`` tells the inner model it is already
     running inside the function and must not call it. The function's
     own tool stays VISIBLE; the model is steered away.
  2. Backstop — recursion depth cap: the wrapper bumps a per-function
     name depth counter and raises ``RecursionError`` if the SAME
     function re-enters itself past ``_MAX_AGENTIC_RECURSION_DEPTH``.

These tests assert both layers directly (no live LLM):

  * the situational prefix carries the recursion warning + function name;
  * the depth backstop raises past the limit;
  * legitimate distinct sub-calls (A→B) are NOT collateral damage;
  * the depth contextvar is restored after return / raise;
  * the self-deny was removed (function name no longer in policy deny).
