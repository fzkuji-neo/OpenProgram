"""``core.md`` is on the system prompt of EVERY turn, so it has a budget.

The budget used to be a gate: a transaction whose staged ``core.md``
measured over the limit was refused whole, including the topic edits it
carried, and the repair guidance told the writer to leave the file alone.
So an oversized block froze and then failed every later write — the whole
conversation lost, not only the fact that would not fit.

It is a rendering limit now. ``topics/core.md`` is the master and takes
whatever it is given; the root file is rebuilt from it in file order until
the next paragraph does not fit. What is left out stays in the master,
still indexed and still searchable, so trimming costs visibility alone.
