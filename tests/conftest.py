# Shipped-tool registry safety net
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# The tool registry is process-global and populated once, at import, by the
# @function side-effect imports in openprogram.programs.tools. Several tests
# legitimately clear / rebuild / channel-filter the registry to exercise it in
# isolation; if any of them leaks (restores an incomplete snapshot, drops a
# tool, or leaves a channel blacklist behind), every *later* test sees a
# registry that's missing shipped tools. Because pytest's file collection order
# is alphabetical and platform-stable, such a leak can bite on CI (Linux) while
# staying dormant locally (macOS) — e.g. the send_message tool going missing
# from test_session_config_tools_intent only under the CI ordering.
#
# This autouse fixture snapshots the fully-loaded shipped registry ONCE at
# session start and, before every test, re-inserts any shipped tool a previous
# test leaked away — without touching ad-hoc tools a test adds on purpose. It's
# a belt-and-suspenders guard: individual tests should still clean up after
# themselves, but no single leak can cascade into unrelated failures.

# Capture the pristine shipped registry at conftest import time — i.e. before
# any test (and any test's registry-clearing fixture) has run — so the snapshot
# is guaranteed complete. A lazily-built session fixture could otherwise be
# instantiated inside a test that had already cleared the registry.
