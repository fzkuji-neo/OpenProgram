/**
 * Attachment chips — for BOTH directions of the conversation.
 *
 * Every attached file is referenced in the message by PATH, not inlined:
 * its bytes are saved to the session workdir (uploads), used in place
 * (@-mentions / typed paths), downloaded to the channel account dir
 * (inbound Telegram / Discord / Slack), or produced by the agent and
 * registered with ``send_file``. Whichever it was, the message carries
 * the same one-line ``[attachment: paper.pdf (pdf, 1531 KB) @json "/abs/path"]``
 * mention. The agent reads the file on demand with its ``read`` / ``pdf``
 * tools — the file body never enters the prompt.
 *
 * Rendering that mention raw in the bubble shows the user ``[attachment:
 * …]`` markers (and, for older chats, inlined ``<file>`` bodies) mixed
 * into their own prose. This module surfaces each attachment as a compact
 * chip — a thumbnail for images — that opens the real file, and keeps the
 * typed text clean. It runs at DISPLAY time only: it parses ``msg.content``
 * into ``{ attachments, text }`` without mutating what was sent to the
 * model. Legacy ``<file>`` / ``[attached:]`` forms are still recognised so
 * historical messages render cleanly too.
