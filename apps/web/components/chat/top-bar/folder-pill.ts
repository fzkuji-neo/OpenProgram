 * The shell of a folder pill in the composer's environment row: one
 * raised pill holding a folder segment (opens the folder's menu) and,
 * when the folder is in a Git checkout, the git segment (GitChip). Each
 * segment is its own hover / click target (`.folder-pill-seg`); the shell
 * only carries the surface, shadow and clipping. Same surface as the
 * `elevated` Button variant, so it sits flush with the other chips.
