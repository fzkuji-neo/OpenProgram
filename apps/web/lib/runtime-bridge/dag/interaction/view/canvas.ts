/**
 * The infinite canvas the DAG is drawn on.
 *
 * The graph used to live in a scroll box sized to its content. That box
 * decided two things it had no business deciding: how big the graph was
 * allowed to be before it needed scrollbars, and where "the middle" was.
 * A wide session got a horizontal scrollbar, a deep one got a vertical
 * one, and reading the whole shape meant scrolling in two axes with no
 * way to zoom out.
 *
 * So there is no box. The SVG fills the pane, everything is drawn inside
 * one ``<g>``, and that group carries a translate + scale the user drives
 * directly — wheel, pinch and drags (``./gestures.ts``), zooming 25%–300%
 * about the cursor so what is under it stays under it.
 *
 * The pane's background paints a dot lattice at the layout's own grid
 * pitch, transformed with the same numbers, so the dots ARE the
 * coordinate system: a node visibly sits on one, and drifting off it is
 * a bug anyone can see without reading the layout code.
 *
 * View state lives in ``store/globals`` per session, so re-rendering the
 * graph — which happens on every capture — leaves the user where they
 * were looking. Only a session switch re-fits.
