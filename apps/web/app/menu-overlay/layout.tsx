/**
 * Minimal shell for the desktop main-menu overlay view. The menu is
 * loaded into its own top-layer WebContentsView (apps/desktop/main.js
 * openMainMenu), so it must NOT be wrapped by the app's (shell) chrome
 * (sidebar, tab strip). This route lives outside the (shell) group, so
 * it already skips that chrome — this layout only strips the page to a
 * transparent, non-scrolling stage for the floating panel.
