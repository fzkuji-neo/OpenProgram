    Loads the session's prior messages, renders history as a plain-text
    prefix bounded by a char budget, calls rt.exec, and appends + saves both
    sides. ``Runtime`` owns layered system-prompt assembly; putting another
    copy into the user message breaks memory recall and provider caching.

    Streaming: when ``console`` is provided (Rich Console), the
    assistant's reply is emitted token-by-token to the terminal via
    ``rt.on_stream``. Caller should skip a redundant final print of
    the same text. Tool calls and thinking blocks render as in-line
    one-liners so the user knows something is happening without
    losing the chat flow.

    When ``console`` is None (e.g. ``--print`` one-shot path) the
    function silently runs to completion and returns the full reply
    string — caller prints it once at the end.
