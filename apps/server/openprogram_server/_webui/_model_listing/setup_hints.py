"""Provider-specific setup instructions surfaced in the web UI's
detail pane.

Plain text with two minor conventions the React renderer
(``apps/web/components/settings/providers/setup-hint.tsx``) recognises:

  * Backticked spans render as inline ``<code>``.
  * ``**bold**`` renders as ``<strong>``.
  * Lines beginning with ``$`` render as a copy-able command row.
  * Consecutive non-blank, non-command lines collapse into one
    paragraph (so the source can stay hard-wrapped at ~72 chars
    without forcing visible mid-sentence line breaks in the UI).

Add a new provider here when its setup needs more than the generic
"paste your API key" flow — OAuth providers, daemon-backed providers,
or anything with platform-specific gotchas. The catalog serialiser
will surface the entry under ``provider.setup_hint`` and the React
side renders it above the API-key field.
