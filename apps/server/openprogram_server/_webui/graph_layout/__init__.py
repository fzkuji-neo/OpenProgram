"""DAG layout pipeline. See README.md for stage breakdown.

Public entry point:

    annotate_graph(graph_entries, head_id) -> graph_entries

Reads ``predecessor`` (conv edge) + ``caller`` (sub-call edge) from each
entry, writes ``_depth`` / ``_lane`` / ``_tier`` back into the same
dicts. Returns the same list (mutated) — except entries filtered out
in stage 1 (microcompact noise), which are dropped from the result so
the frontend never sees them.
