"""Lane (branch column) assignment for the session DAG.

Rule (docs/design/runtime/dag-layout-algorithm.md §2): count branches,
number them in the order they appear (by seq), starting from 0. No
"trunk" special case, no zeroing.

A branch = a conversation chain. Walk from a start node down the
``caller`` sub-call tree AND the ``predecessor`` conversation chain,
claiming every node into the same lane. At a fork (same predecessor
with >1 child), the first sibling continues the lane; each later
sibling starts a NEW branch → next lane number.

Lane numbers are assigned in seq order of branch starts:
  * ROOT (and the trunk hanging off it) → lane 0
  * each fork's later siblings → next lane, in the order they appear
