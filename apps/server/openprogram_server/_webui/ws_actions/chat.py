    the outgoing request: the model saw the picture, the human saw an
    empty bubble, and a reload lost it entirely. One path in the message
    is what lets the chat render it back.

    This is the backend half of the uniform "every file is a path"
    model. A browser upload has no source path, so its bytes are saved
    under ``<session workdir>/attachments/`` and that generated path is
    written into the marker. An Electron upload already carries the

    immutable session-copy path used by local previews. The raw-file endpoint
    therefore stays within its existing readable roots. The agent reads the
    original marker path on demand; the file body is never inlined into the
    prompt.

    (Files that already live on disk — ``@``-mentions / typed paths —
    skip this entirely: the frontend emits the absolute path directly,
    no copy. See ``at-mention.ts`` / ``/api/file-resolve``.)
