"""Smoke test: a third-party harness installed as a REAL directory under
agentics/ (i.e. ``git clone``-d, NOT symlinked) is auto-discovered and
its @agentic_function registers.

This is the behavior the install flow promises: drop a harness folder
into agentics/, it just works — no symlink (which needs admin/developer
mode on Windows). Runs fully offline in a temp dir; touches no real state.
