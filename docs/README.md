**We propose _Agentic Programming_.** An LLM is flexible; code is deterministic. Let the model run everything and you get chaos — unpredictable execution, context explosion, no output guarantees; hard-code everything and you lose the intelligence. A **harness** balances the two, interleaved moment to moment — **Python for the flow you want fixed, the LLM for the judgement you can't script.** ([the full rationale →](capabilities/agentic-programming/philosophy.md))

## Install

```bash
curl -fsSL https://openprogram.io/install | sh
```

Windows x86_64 CLI/server:

```powershell
irm https://openprogram.io/install.ps1 | iex
```

Desktop: macOS releases use the signed and notarized DMG; Windows uses a signed `win-x64.exe` when that artifact is attached to the [GitHub Release](https://github.com/fzkuji-neo/OpenProgram/releases). Linux and Windows without that EXE use the complete CLI/server runtime and Web UI.

Platform matrix, PATH, `openprogram doctor`, and source-checkout install: **[Installation](install/install.md)**.

## Quick start

The first `openprogram` run opens a provider setup wizard, then the terminal chat. Re-run the wizard with `openprogram setup`.

```bash
openprogram
```

Open the Web UI at http://localhost:18100:

```bash
openprogram web
```

Confirm with one printed reply:

```bash
openprogram --print "Introduce yourself in one sentence"
```

GUI Agent, Research Agent, and Wiki Agent ship with every supported release. Third-party Programs use `openprogram programs install <owner>/<repo>`. Details: [Getting Started](start/GETTING_STARTED.md).

## Why OpenProgram?

OpenProgram supports macOS and Linux installations, native Windows x86_64 CLI/server, multiple providers, a full terminal UI, and a Web interface (Desktop App or `openprogram web` → http://localhost:18100). The Windows Desktop distribution path produces a signed per-user installer and embeds the same complete runtime; Windows sandbox execution remains separate. The Windows release includes the Ink TUI and falls back to the Python Rich interface only when the terminal cannot provide raw input. Mobile devices can use the browser client against a supported remote host. The harness itself provides **three mechanisms for building agent programs.**

### 1. DAG Context — for native multi-agent systems

<p align="center">

    <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" srcset="images/highlights/01-dag-context.png">
    <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: light)" srcset="images/highlights/01-dag-context-light.png">
    <img src="images/highlights/01-dag-context.png" alt="DAG Context — every user, LLM, and function call is one node on a single flat DAG; each @agentic_function declares in one line what context it reads and exposes, so fork, spawn, cross-session messaging, and worktree isolation all follow" width="900">
  </picture>
</p>

Every user turn, LLM call, and function call is **one node on a single flat DAG**. Two edges give it meaning: `caller` (who invoked whom) and `reads` (whose output fed this prompt) — so context is assembled from the graph, not hand-stitched. Each `@agentic_function` is **programmable context in one line**: `expose` controls what a call reveals to its parent, and `render_range` controls how much history a call pulls in (`{"callers": 0}` gives a throwaway, self-isolated scratch context that's reclaimed when it returns — no unbounded prompt growth).

Because context is an **addressable node rather than a per-agent buffer**, multi-agent stops being a bolt-on: fork a branch, `spawn` a clean sub-agent, `send_message` across sessions, or run a file-touching branch in an isolated `git worktree` — each is just "select a different node set as context" on the same DAG.

### 2. Agentic Workflow — for trustworthy & self-evolving agents

<p align="center">
  <picture>
    <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" srcset="images/highlights/02-agentic-workflow.png">
    <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: light)" srcset="images/highlights/02-agentic-workflow-light.png">
    <img src="images/highlights/02-agentic-workflow.png" alt="Agentic Workflow — Python drives the flow and code gates enforce the critical steps; a failed validation makes the model re-decide so it cannot skip checks; the agent writes and hot-loads its own @agentic_functions" width="900">
  </picture>
</p>

**Python drives the flow; the LLM reasons only when asked.** Critical steps become **code gates** — the model's choice is parsed and validated by code, and a failed check makes it *re-decide* instead of quietly moving on, so validation can't be skipped. Every call is a retryable, observable DAG node. That's what makes execution *trustworthy*: the guarantees live in code, not in the model's goodwill.

*Self-evolving* is a mechanism, not a black box: the agent writes and fixes its own `@agentic_function`s with **ordinary file-edit tools**, a file watcher hot-loads them, and the new tool is live on the next turn — no dedicated `create()` / `fix()` machinery.

### 3. Event Infrastructure — for proactive agents

<p align="center">
  <picture>
    <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" srcset="images/highlights/03-event-infrastructure.png">
    <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: light)" srcset="images/highlights/03-event-infrastructure-light.png">
    <img src="images/highlights/03-event-infrastructure.png" alt="Event Infrastructure — a unified process-wide event bus that the agent loop, auth, context, channels, and memory all emit onto; anything can subscribe by event type, and a proactive policy layer builds on top" width="900">
  </picture>
</p>

One **process-wide event bus** is the substrate under everything: the agent loop, auth, context, channels, and memory all emit onto it, and any component can subscribe by event type (every event is a uniform `Event(type, payload, ts)` envelope with `id` / `origin` / `metadata`). This is deliberately a **foundation** — a proactive policy layer that watches the stream and acts is the bus's first intended consumer. The plumbing is in place; the proactivity is yours to build on it.

## Also in the product

The three mechanisms above are the thesis. Below are other designs that are not the usual shape — shipped items are checked.

- [x] 🧠 **Scriptorium.** Markdown under `~/.openprogram/memory/`, every paragraph cited, written in background batches — there is no "save this" tool. [Details](https://github.com/Fzkuji/Scriptorium)
- [x] ♾️ **Infinite Context.** Occupancy drives `/compact` and automatic compact; tool results inside a single turn can compact without another command; original records stay in the session. [Details](interfaces/tui.md)
- [x] 🌿 **Conversation stored as git.** History is a repo, not a list: branch, attach, and merge from the sidebar. [Details](start/features.md#conversation-as-a-git-dag)
- [x] 🎯 **Goals in ordinary chat.** Persistent goals with bound todo plans live in the same conversation, not a separate Goal mode.
- [ ] 👁️ **Proactive policies.** The event bus is live; a layer that watches it and acts on its own is the next piece of that design.
- [ ] 🖥️ **Agent terminal.** A host-owned PTY for the agent is underway — not yet a chat tool.
- [ ] 🔄 **Self-update.** The agent patching and replacing its own runtime in conversation — with owner approval, verification, and recovery — is still a goal. [Details](install/upgrade.md#recovering-a-conversational-self-update)
