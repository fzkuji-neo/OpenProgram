# Goals in chat

A Goal keeps an objective active across ordinary chat turns. The current agent does the work with the conversation's tools, model, permissions and history. At the end of a successful turn, the runtime continues an active Goal with another ordinary chat turn. There is no nested working agent or automatic separate judge in chat mode.

## Start and plan

Enter `/goal <objective>`, or use **Programs → Workflow → goal → Use**. The form starts a chat Goal; it does not execute the Python Workflow. You can also explicitly ask the agent to create a Goal.

The agent uses `todo_create`, `todo_update` and `todo_list` to maintain a plan for multi-step work. New items created during Goal work are associated with the Goal and its revision. The Goal details show their progress after a turn. The objective remains independent of the plan: checking every item does not by itself prove completion.

The agent must check current evidence against every requirement before calling `update_goal(status="complete")`. The runtime rejects completion while associated todos remain unfinished. This is a structural check; it is not independent semantic verification. A simple objective does not require an artificial todo list.

## Control execution

The Goal details retain the objective, status, usage and progress after page reload. When there are no todos, the badge and details omit todo progress without a placeholder; the Goal status remains visible. Use the existing chat input to add instructions, following its normal queue or steering mode.

- `/goal`: read the current state.
- `/goal pause`: save a pause and request cancellation of the current execution.
- `/goal resume`: continue a paused Goal with cumulative usage.
- `/goal edit <objective>`: save a new revision and pause; resume explicitly when ready.
- `/goal clear`: cancel the Goal.
- `/goal budget max_turns=10 max_tokens=10000`: change limits; zero removes a limit.

Goals have no round limit by default. Only an explicit positive `goal.max_turns` or start-time round budget sets a cap; reaching it is not completion. The progress badge shows todo completion, not execution rounds. Existing Goals retain their saved budgets: use `/goal budget max_turns=0` to remove an old round cap without resetting work or usage. Explicit token, active-time and cost limits use cumulative usage. A depleted budget must be increased or removed before resuming. Waiting time is excluded from active time. Automatic continuation does not expand tool permissions.

A failed or cancelled execution stops automatic continuation. Worker restart leaves interrupted Goals recoverably paused. Resume is explicit; external-event wakeups are not implemented. A wait or unresolved execution is not evidence of Goal completion.

The state tools are short operations: `create_goal`, `get_goal`, and `update_goal`. They do not perform the task. The agent may mark `blocked` only after the same verified blocker recurs for at least three consecutive Goal turns with no independent work remaining. The runtime enforces the minimum turn count; the agent is responsible for verifying that it is the same blocker.

## Python Workflow compatibility

Direct Python and composed Workflow calls to `goal()` retain their existing work/refinement/judge contract. This compatibility path is distinct from chat Goals. It accepts `context_mode`, work/judge model settings and execution limits. Chat mode uses the conversation's work model and does not use those separate role settings.

The chat form preserves explicit round, token, active-time and cost limits. It rejects separate Workflow role options and isolated context; change the conversation's settings for chat work instead. In the Rich REPL, `/goal` starts a canonical chat execution and prints its execution ID.

See the [engineering design](../reference/design/runtime/goal.md) for the migration and implementation evidence.
