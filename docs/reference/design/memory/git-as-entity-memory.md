# Entity Memory on Git: Session-Git + Project-Git

> **Implementation status:** This is a deferred design proposal. The current
> Memory runtime does not create `openprogram/memory/session_git/`, commit one
> Git revision per turn, or provide the replay/project-Git lifecycle described
> here. See [`overview.md`](overview.md) for the active Source/Topic design.

## Mental Model

"Entity memory" = things that actually happened, replayable step by step. Git is
natively this paradigm (a commit is immutable, the log is a timeline, checkout is
a time machine), so entity memory reuses git directly rather than building a
separate store.

The memory model as a whole is 4+1:

```
Entity memory (raw, replayable)
  ├─ Session memory     ← session-level git (one commit per turn)
  └─ Project memory     ← project-level git (bound to the working directory, file edits auto-commit)

Abstract memory (derived, distilled from entity memory)
  ├─ Journal (timeline)
  └─ Wiki (knowledge graph)

Core (self-knowledge)                 ← memory/core.md
```

This document covers **entity memory** (the first two blocks). Abstract memory
and the mapping between the tiers are covered in
[`virtual-memory.md`](virtual-memory.md) and [`overview.md`](overview.md).

## 1. Relationship to the Existing DAG

**Not a replacement — an overlay.** The DAG (SQLite) stays; git is synced
incrementally.

- DAG strengths: fast SQL queries, indexes on caller / parent_id / seq, commit chain already running
- Git strengths: mature tooling (log / diff / checkout / revert), atomic persistence, the user can just cd in and look
- Dual write: after writing the DAG node for each turn, also git commit a JSON serialization

The read path still goes through the DAG (commit etc.). Git is the entry point
for **replay + backup + user visibility**.

## 2. Session-Git

### 2.1 File Layout

One independent git repo per session:

```
~/.openprogram/sessions/<session_id>/
├── .git/
├── meta.json              # session metadata (title, agent_id, model, ...)
├── messages/
│   ├── 000001-u-abc123.json    # user message
│   ├── 000002-a-def456.json    # assistant message
│   ├── 000003-t-fc_xxx.json    # tool result (caller=def456)
│   ├── 000004-a-ghi789.json
│   └── ...
└── commits/
    └── commit_xxx.json      # one per context commit (optional)
```

File names sort by `<seq>-<role[0]>-<node_id>.json` — the numeric prefix makes
the ls order equal the chronological order, without relying on filesystem sort
order.

Each message file's content is just the JSON serialization of the DAG node:
```json
{
  "id": "abc123",
  "role": "user",
  "content": "你好",
  "predecessor": null,
  "caller": null,
  "created_at": 1779500000.0,
  "metadata": {...}
}
```

### 2.2 Commit Timing

One commit at the end of **each turn**, not one per message — per-message commits
are too fine-grained to be useful. End of turn = when
`dispatcher.process_user_turn()` returns a TurnResult.

A turn contains:
- 1 user message
- 1 assistant placeholder → eventually filled with content
- N tool results (caller = assistant)

commit message:

```
turn <N>: <first 60 chars of user msg>

assistant: <first 80 chars of reply>
tools: read, grep × 3, list

[meta: turn took 12.3s, 18 tools, 4521 tokens]
```

### 2.3 Branch / Retry

The DAG has retry branches (multiple conv-children sharing a parent), mapped onto
git:

- the session repo's default branch = `main` (= the current HEAD path)
- when a new retry is triggered on the DAG, a git branch `retry-<assistant_id>` is created and becomes current
- switching the DAG head → checkout the git branch
- the user's "switch branch" in the UI → backend `git checkout`

A git branch and a DAG branch are two views of the same thing.

### 2.4 Replay UI

prev / next controls at the top of chat / on the right of the history area:

```
[← prev turn]  Turn 7 / 12  [next turn →]    [view full history]
```

- prev: `git checkout HEAD~1` + replay the UI to that state
- next: walk the reflog backward
- view full history: pop a timeline (one line per commit, click to view the message content)

At the implementation level: WS action `git_history(session_id)` returns the
commit log, `git_checkout(session_id, commit_sha)` switches to a given state, and
the dispatcher continues the next user message on top of that commit.

### 2.5 Dual-Write Consistency

**Main path**: the dispatcher writes the DAG.
**Mirror**: after a turn completes, all of that turn's nodes are asynchronously
serialized to the session repo and committed.

It is async because a git commit takes ~100-500ms and shouldn't block the user.
It runs in the background with `threading.Thread`; on failure it logs and does
not block.

Conflict probability is very low (one repo per session, serial commits), with a
file lock as a fallback.

### 2.6 Migrating Old Sessions

On startup, the existing SessionDB is scanned and sessions without a repo get a
one-time backfill: walk the nodes by seq and commit them out turn by turn. It
runs once, then stays incremental.

## 3. Project-Git

### 3.1 Concept

A Project = a long-running unit of work, e.g. "wiki-agent refactor". It:
- is associated with a **filesystem directory** (the user's code repo / docs repo, e.g. `/Users/x/code/wiki-agent`)
- is associated with **multiple sessions** (the user's many conversations on this project)
- has a name / description / status

A Project itself **is the user's git repo** (if not yet init'd, the agent inits
one for them).

When the agent runs tools in the project working directory to edit files, those
edits auto-commit to the project repo.

### 3.2 Association

```python
class Project:
    id: str
    name: str
    workdir: str               # absolute path, a directory in the user's filesystem
    sessions: list[str]        # list of session ids (who is working in this project)
    status: "active" | "paused" | "done"
    created_at: float

# Reverse association:
Session.metadata["project_id"] = "proj_xxx"   # added to the sessions table
```

A session can exist standalone (no project). When there is a project, the commits
triggered by the agent's file edits land in the project repo.

### 3.3 Agent File Edits Trigger Auto-Commit

Side-effecting tools like write/edit/apply_patch edit files in the project
workdir. The hook:

```
end of turn:
  if session.project_id:
    proj = load_project(session.project_id)
    with cwd(proj.workdir):
      if git_status_dirty():
        git add -A
        git commit -m "[agent <session_id>] turn <N>: <user msg first 60 chars>"
```

The committer is marked "agent (claude-sonnet-4.7 via OpenProgram)" to
distinguish these from commits the user made manually.

### 3.4 User Manual Edits vs Agent Edits

When the user edits files in their IDE, that is not a commit triggered by
OpenProgram. Before each turn ends, the agent first runs `git status` to check
for dirty state:

- all changes are the agent's → the agent commits once
- there are uncommitted user changes → the agent **does nothing** (the user's
  working tree must not be polluted) and warns in the UI: "you have uncommitted
  changes, the agent's edits won't be auto-committed for now"

The alternative of giving the agent a dedicated branch `agent/<session_id>` and
letting the user merge afterwards was rejected as more machinery than the
problem needs: the user is responsible for managing git themselves, and the agent
only commits when the tree is clean.

### 3.5 Sessions Not Bound to a Project

Fully standalone. Not every session is forced to belong to some project.

"Create project" in the UI is an explicit action — the user picks a directory +
gives it a name. An existing session can join a project, and subsequent work
commits to it.

## 4. UI / Entry Points

### 4.1 Session History Replay

At the top of chat / in the right column:
- a timeline view (one line per commit)
- "← prev turn" / "next turn →" buttons
- pick a commit → replay to that state, newly sent messages fork from there

Coexists with the DAG history view: the DAG shows branch structure, the git
timeline shows chronological order.

### 4.2 Projects Panel

A "Projects" section in the left sidebar:

```
─ Projects ─────────
  ● Wiki Agent Refactor   2 sessions  ●  active
  ○ DAG Visualization    1 session   done
  ○ ...
  + New Project
```

Clicking a project opens the project detail page: name / workdir / associated
sessions / commit history / abstract-memory entry point.

New project flow: pick a directory → name it → create / reuse a git repo →
associate the current session (optional).

### 4.3 Project Indicator at the Top of Chat

If the current session is associated with a project, the top status area shows
the project name + an abbreviated workdir; clicking it goes to the project page.

## 5. Key Invariants

1. **The DAG is the current source of truth, Git is the mirror.** A git failure
   doesn't affect the DAG. Not the other way around — git landed but the DAG not
   written is dirty data.
2. **Session-git is one commit per turn**, not subdivided by message.
3. **Project-git favors cleanliness**: the user's working tree must not be
   polluted by the agent. When there are uncommitted changes the agent skips the
   commit.
4. **Replay doesn't break the DAG**: a checkout is a read-only view; when the
   user sends a new message it forks a new branch on the DAG based on that
   commit.
5. **Abstract memory builds on entity memory**, not the other way around.

## 6. Risks

- **Async git commit failure**: invisible to the user, silently dropping data.
  Mitigation: background-thread retry on failure + validate DAG seq vs git commit
  count on startup, trigger a backfill on mismatch.
- **Project workdir is not a git repo**: auto `git init` on the agent's first
  commit. A repo the user already has under git: reuse directly.
- **Multiple sessions concurrently editing the same project**: a file lock
  serializes project commits. In the extreme case it degenerates to a queue.
- **Semantics of replay + continuing to chat**: after the user goes back to turn
  5 and sends a new message, the result is a fork rather than an overwrite of what
  came after (the DAG already has this concept via retry), which maps naturally to
  a git branch.

## 7. Comparison with Claude Code

- Claude Code also supports replay (it has a "rewind to previous user message" UI)
- the implementation isn't public, but most likely it treats session messages as
  documents + uses some commit-like mechanism
- this design **uses git explicitly**, so the user can directly
  `cd ~/.openprogram/sessions/<sid>` to view history — higher transparency

## 8. Relationship with the Existing commit chain

No conflict. The commit chain is "the context view the LLM sees", while git is
"the history that actually happened" — two layers:

- DAG nodes (the raw source of truth) → git commits (persisted mirror)
- the ContextCommit chain (the LLM's view) → not in git (derived, recomputable)

A commit can be selectively exported to git (e.g. the user wants to see "what the
LLM saw back then"), but it's not mandatory.

## Appendix: Proposed Build Order

The work splits into five independently verifiable pieces:

1. **Session-git infrastructure** — module `openprogram/memory/session_git/`
   (init / commit / log / checkout wrappers); hook at the end of
   `dispatcher.process_user_turn` running the commit on a background thread;
   backfill script turning old sessions into git repos; WS actions
   `git_session_log`, `git_session_checkout`.
2. **Project schema + UI** — DB table `projects` (id, name, workdir, status, …);
   `project_id` on the sessions table; WS `list_projects`, `create_project`,
   `add_session_to_project`; Projects section in the left sidebar.
3. **Project-git auto-commit** — project commit hook after a turn for sessions
   with a bound `project_id`; commit when clean, warn when dirty; UI warning
   banner.
4. **Replay UI** — prev/next at the top of chat + timeline view; WS action
   calling git_checkout to replay history.
5. **Data migration** — backfill over all existing sessions; existing git
   projects imported as Projects.
