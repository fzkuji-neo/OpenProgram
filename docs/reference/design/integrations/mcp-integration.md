# MCP Tool Integration

> This document is the design of the MCP client layer: the role OpenProgram
> plays in the protocol, where the module lives, how servers are configured
> and connected, and how MCP tools reach the LLM. Related code:
> `openprogram/mcp/`.

## In one sentence

Register the tools provided by an external MCP server as in-framework `AgentTool`s, so the LLM calls them exactly the way it calls a local `@function`/`@agentic_function`. On worker startup, spawn a subprocess for every enabled server in the config file, run JSON-RPC over stdio, wrap their `tools/list`, and mount the result into `_registry`.

## Role — we are the client, not the server

MCP is a protocol that defines a "tool provider" (server) and a "tool consumer" (client).

| Role | Who plays it | Examples |
|------|------|------|
| Server | The process that provides tools | `@drawio/mcp`, `@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem` |
| Client | The LLM framework, which exposes the server's tools to the LLM | OpenProgram, Claude Desktop, Claude Code, Cursor, Cline, opencode |

We are the client. This design **does not cover** exposing OpenProgram's own tools to an external client — that direction is a separate, standalone module that does not reuse the code in `openprogram/mcp/`, documented in the authoritative [MCP server design and evidence](mcp-server.html).

## Directory location

`openprogram/mcp/` is a **top-level module**, a sibling of `openprogram/channels/`. It does **not** live under `openprogram/programs/`.

Rationale:
- MCP is an **external-protocol adapter layer**, which is a different thing from "the implementation of a function." Our function system (`@function` / `@agentic_function` / the code under `agentics/`) is locally-implemented tools; MCP is tools fetched from an external process. The two layers are orthogonal concepts.
- Both opencode (`src/mcp/`) and Claude Code (`src/services/mcp/`) treat MCP as a standalone module, fully separate from local tool implementations.
- In our project, `channels/` (message channels) is the existing precedent for an "external-protocol adapter" — it brings external message sources in. MCP also brings something external in, just a tool source instead, so its **location should match channels**.

## Reference implementation

For a full side-by-side, see `references/opencode/packages/opencode/src/mcp/`. OpenProgram's MCP layer is essentially a Python translation of opencode's.

`references/hermes-agent/mcp_serve.py` and `references/openclaw/src/mcp/` also provide MCP, but **both are the server side** (exposing their own capabilities to Claude Desktop and the like), which is the opposite direction of what we're doing.

## Configuration

`<state_dir>/mcp_servers.json` (default `~/.openprogram/mcp_servers.json`; the path follows profile switches automatically via `paths.get_state_dir`).

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "drawio": {
      "type": "local",
      "command": ["npx", "-y", "@drawio/mcp"],
      "env": {},
      "enabled": true,
      "timeout_seconds": 60
    }
  }
}
```

| Field | Description |
|------|------|
| `type` | `"local"` (stdio subprocess), `"http"` (Streamable HTTP), or `"sse"` (legacy SSE). Remote types take `url` / `headers` / `auth` (`none`, `bearer`, or `oauth`) |
| `command` | Subprocess command + argument list |
| `env` | Environment variables injected into the subprocess (the base environment is inherited from the parent process; this overrides / appends to it) |
| `enabled` | Set false to temporarily disable a server without deleting its config |
| `timeout_seconds` | Startup wait + the read timeout for a single call |

A missing file or a parse failure is non-fatal — `load_configs()` returns an empty list, the worker starts normally, and one warning line is logged. MCP is an opt-in feature.

### Credentials

`env` and `headers` are free-form, so any entry can hold a credential: `ENDPOINT` can carry a signed URL as readily as `API_KEY` carries a key. Rather than guess from names, every value in both maps is treated as a secret, alongside the bearer token and the OAuth client secret.

Two serializations keep that separation explicit. `MCPServerConfig.to_storage_dict()` carries full values and is used only to write `mcp_servers.json`. `to_response_dict()` replaces each value with `{"has_value": bool, "masked": str}` and reduces the auth secrets to `has_token` / `has_client_secret` plus a mask, and it is what every route returns — `/api/mcp/servers`, `/api/mcp/servers/{name}`, `/api/mcp/catalog`, and `/api/mcp/catalog/diff`. No route returns a stored MCP credential.

`PATCH /api/mcp/servers/{name}` therefore cannot ask the client to send back what it was shown. It applies preserve / replace / delete per name:

| Body | Meaning |
|------|------|
| name absent (or the whole `env` / `headers` field absent) | **preserve** the stored value |
| name present with a value | **replace** with that value |
| name present with an empty string | **delete** the name |

The same rule covers `auth.token` and `auth.client_secret`. Changing `auth.kind` drops the other kind's secret, since it is no longer reachable or useful. The Web UI opens its secret inputs empty and lists only the stored names, so an untouched field is omitted and preserved.

The config file holds these secrets, so `save_configs()` writes it owner-only: a temp file created `0600` in one syscall, `fsync`, then `os.replace`. A file left `0644` by an older version narrows on its next save. The route persists only after the restart succeeds, so an edit that fails to start leaves the stored credentials intact.

## Code structure

```
openprogram/mcp/
  __init__.py    public re-exports: load_mcp_servers / shutdown_mcp_servers / server_status
  config.py      MCPServerConfig + load_configs (reads mcp_servers.json, purely static)
  client.py     MCPClient — a single server's stdio subprocess + ClientSession + supervisor task
  adapter.py    MCP wire types ↔ AgentTool type translation (pure functions, stateless)
  registry.py    global manager: load_mcp_servers / shutdown_mcp_servers / server_status
```

Four files, one responsibility each: config, single connection, translation, management.

## Call path — there is only one, LLM-initiated automatically

```
You type "draw a flowchart" in the webui
  ↓
worker → agent_loop → calls the LLM API with all tools (local + MCP)
  ↓
LLM decides, emits tool_call(name="drawio__open_drawio_xml", args={...})
  ↓
agent_loop looks up the AgentTool in _registry, awaits execute(args)
  ↓ execute is the closure built in adapter.register_remote_tool
  ↓ the closure has captured the corresponding MCPClient, and directly calls client.call_tool(original tool name, args)
  ↓ MCPClient sends it over stdio JSON-RPC to the corresponding drawio subprocess
  ↓
the drawio MCP subprocess executes (invokes the macOS open command to launch the browser)
  ↓ returns CallToolResult
  ↓
adapter.convert_call_result turns the MCP content blocks into an AgentToolResult
  ↓
agent_loop stuffs the result into chat history and calls the LLM once more
  ↓
the LLM sees the tool result and generates the final text reply "Done"
  ↓
the webui displays it
```

The whole chain completes synchronously on the FastAPI main loop, with **no cross-thread / cross-event-loop scheduling involved**.

`/api/run/{name}` / the CLI `programs run` / the `/programs` page do **not** wire up MCP tools — those are entry points for local functions. MCP tools are invisible to the user; the LLM uses them implicitly.

## Key technical decisions

### 1. Persistent connection + supervisor task

MCP is designed around a long-lived bidirectional connection (the server can push progress notifications, resource-update notifications, etc.). The official Python SDK exposes the session as a nested async-context-manager:

```python
async with stdio_client(params) as (r, w):
    async with ClientSession(r, w) as session:
        await session.initialize()
        ...
```

Holding a context manager across function calls requires keeping `__aexit__` pending, for which Python has no direct API. The cleanest approach is to wrap the whole nested block in a long-lived coroutine and put it in an `asyncio.Task` acting as a supervisor:

```python
async def _supervisor(self):
    async with stdio_client(params) as (r, w):
        async with ClientSession(r, w) as session:
            await session.initialize()
            result = await session.list_tools()
            self._session = session
            self.tools = list(result.tools)
            self._ready.set()
            await self._shutdown.wait()      # stay parked here, waiting for the shutdown signal
```

`start()` creates the supervisor task and `await self._ready.wait()`; `call_tool()` simply reuses `self._session`; `stop()` sets `self._shutdown`, the supervisor exits the nested `async with`, and the subprocess closes automatically.

A startup failure (the spawn doesn't come up, or initialize errors out) also goes through `self._ready.set()`, sets `self.error` to the reason string, unblocks `start()`, and the manager, seeing the error, skips tool registration and logs one line.

### 2. Tool namespace `{server}__{tool}`

opencode uses `{server}:{tool}` as the namespace separator. We switch to a double underscore, `{server}__{tool}`, because OpenAI's tool-name regex is `^[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+$`, which rejects the colon. Anthropic uses the same character set.

`adapter.namespace_tool_name(server, tool)` does both:
- replaces any character outside `[A-Za-z0-9_-]` with `_`
- truncates to 64 characters (OpenAI's hard limit), preserving the tool suffix

Same-named tools across servers will collide, and the later-registered one overrides the earlier — consistent with last-wins elsewhere in the framework.

### 3. eager spawn vs. lazy spawn

opencode is lazy: it doesn't connect when the service is instantiated; it spawns on the first `tools()` call. We choose **eager**: `load_mcp_servers()` runs to completion in the FastAPI startup hook before the worker enters its serving state.

Rationale: eager is simple to implement and leaves the state stable after startup. The cost is that each enabled server can block for up to `timeout_seconds` (servers start sequentially, one at a time). drawio-mcp's first `npx -y @drawio/mcp` also has to download from npm, which can be slow, so the timeout defaults to 30s and the user can raise it.

Non-fatal: if a server fails to start, the manager records the error, skips registering its tools, and the worker keeps starting and can still use the other servers (and all local tools).

### 4. Tolerant content conversion

`adapter.convert_call_result()` handles the MCP return value:

| MCP type | Converted to |
|---|---|
| `TextContent` | `providers.types.TextContent` (chat history) |
| `ImageContent` | `providers.types.ImageContent` (multimodal LLM) |
| `EmbeddedResource` | expanded into `[resource: <uri>]` text — raw bytes are not stuffed into chat |
| unknown / future types | `repr(block)` text — at least the LLM can see that something came back |

An `isError=True` return is reflected in `details["is_error"]`, and what the LLM sees in chat history is the tool-result text, consistent with the error path of local tools.

### 5. Test isolation — beware of `from openprogram.paths import get_state_dir`

`tests/integration/store/test_attach_lazy_session.py` uses `monkeypatch.setattr("openprogram.paths.get_state_dir", ...)` to redirect the state directory. If `config.py` pulls it in via `from openprogram.paths import get_state_dir`, the first import happens **during** the attach test (because the webui startup hook triggers `_start_mcp_servers` → import `openprogram.mcp` → import `config`), and the lambda gets permanently bound into our module, leaking after the attach test ends.

Fix: `from openprogram import paths as _paths`, and look up the attribute live on every call to `_paths.get_state_dir()`. Watch out: if the test suite adds a new paths monkeypatch, confirm our `config.py` still goes through the module reference.

## Appendix: Implementation Status

The design above is implemented over the stdio transport. The boundaries of
what is built:

1. **All three transports are implemented** (stdio, Streamable HTTP, SSE). Remote auth supports static bearer tokens and OAuth 2.1 PKCE. OAuth is delegated to the MCP SDK's `OAuthClientProvider` via `token_storage.PersistentOAuthProvider`, which persists what a silent reconnect needs across worker restarts: tokens plus an absolute `expires_at`, the dynamic client registration (whose loopback redirect port is reused so re-auth presents a registered redirect_uri), and the discovered authorization-server metadata (so a cold-start refresh POSTs to the real token endpoint, not the `<server>/token` fallback). An expired access token is renewed with the refresh token in the background; the browser consent flow only runs on first auth or when refresh is rejected, which the supervisor surfaces as `error_kind="needs_reauth"`.
2. **`tools/*` is the only protocol surface consumed.** MCP also defines `prompts/*`, `resources/*`, and `sampling/*`, none of which has a corresponding concept in the framework. `sampling/createMessage` would let a server borrow the client's LLM for inference; the client rejects such requests today.
3. **A config change takes effect on worker restart.** The server list is not hot-reloaded, and `MCPClient` has no `restart` between `start()` and `stop()`. A `restart_server(name)` API would remove the need to restart the whole worker.
4. **Concurrent calls to one server serialize on the ClientSession lock.** `MCPClient._call_lock` queues them. This is not a performance problem — an MCP server is single-flight to begin with — but one slow tool blocks other tool calls on the same server.
5. **The tool list is read once.** The supervisor pulls `list_tools` at startup and never asks again, so tools a server adds or removes mid-flight are invisible. The protocol's `tools/list_changed` notification is not listened for.
6. **`_loaded` is a module global.** Tests reset it before re-testing; see the `tests/integration/programs/test_mcp_client.py::_reset_mcp_loader_flag` fixture.

The webui settings page does not yet render `server_status()`; doing so would
surface each server's status, error message, tool count, and most recent call
result.
