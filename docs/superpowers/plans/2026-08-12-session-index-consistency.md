# Session Index Consistency Task Brief and Ledger

## Contract

- Approved design: `docs/reference/design/runtime/session/index-consistency.html`.
- Base commit: `e831d0f0`.
- Production files: `openprogram/store/session/session_store.py`, `openprogram/store/session/session_node_writer.py`.
- Public tests: metadata-only updates preserve `updated_at` and ordering; append advances meta/index together; list rows are snapshots; an update during an older disk write remains dirty and reaches the next flush; concurrent update/list/flush leaves parseable, current JSON.
- Concurrency: registry dict, dirty state, and timer share one state lock; physical writes are ordered separately; no registry file I/O while holding the state lock.
- Compatibility: index schema, list filters/order, caller-supplied creation timestamps, and atomic file replacement stay unchanged.
- Exclusions: DAG node concurrency, `mark_merged` transaction redesign, project locations, Windows, credential stores, orphan files, auth work, and unrelated audit findings.

## Ledger

| Evidence | Result |
|---|---|
| Base | `e831d0f0` |
| Design | `0a66a3cc` (`docs(session): define index consistency contract`) |
| RED | `tests/unit/test_session_index_consistency.py`: 3 failed; meta timestamp overwritten, returned row mutated registry, and an in-flight old save cleared newer dirty state |
| GREEN | Final contract coverage: 9 passed, including set-head, non-head node append, side-branch append, deferred and direct writes |
| Affected verification | 107 passed in independent quality review; scoped Ruff passed; `git diff --check` passed |
| Specification review | PASS after `09480e0f`; set-head and non-head node findings repaired |
| Quality review | PASS at `c50b5180`; write-failure retry, 6-writer concurrency, deadlock, reload and final JSON probes passed |
| Full gate | 107 passed; Ruff passed; docs 459 pages; 0 broken links; `git diff --check` passed |
| Final implementation | `9fef648c`, `09480e0f`, `c50b5180` |
