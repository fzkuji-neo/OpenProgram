# WebSocket Command Lifecycle Task Brief and Ledger

## Contract

- Approved design: `docs/reference/design/ui/websocket-command-lifecycle.html`.
- Base commit: `c1f10273`.
- Production file: `openprogram/webui/server.py`.
- Test file: `tests/unit/test_websocket_command_lifecycle.py`.
- Public RED cases: handler failure followed by ping on one socket; invalid JSON followed by ping; last focused connection disconnect releases legacy follow-up with `None`; another focused connection preserves wait and can answer; empty string remains a real answer.
- Error/privacy: client receives a stable generic `handler_error`; payload and exception message are not returned; local structured log retains traceback.
- Ownership/concurrency: dispatcher never clears action-owned reservation; only the last focused connection signals the session queue; queue removal remains owned by `_web_follow_up`.
- Compatibility: unknown-action frame and normal answers unchanged; socket write failure still terminates transport; runtime QuestionRegistry unchanged.
- Exclusions: global ask-user redesign, runtime.ask/ACP/channel protocols, send queue changes, Windows, credential store, orphan files, and other audit findings.

## Ledger

| Evidence | Result |
|---|---|
| Base | `c1f10273` |
| Design | `84fe7da9` (`docs(web): define websocket command lifecycle`) |
| RED | `tests/unit/test_websocket_command_lifecycle.py`: 2 failed, 3 passed; handler failure closed the socket before ping, and last focused disconnect left the legacy follow-up thread waiting |
| GREEN | Initial implementation: 5 passed; review repairs added malformed metadata, repeated disconnect/cancel, transport disconnect, and unknown-action coverage |
| Affected verification | 67 passed; scoped Ruff passed; `git diff --check` passed |
| Specification review | PASS at `4bc76c83`; 63 passed plus unknown-action and transport-write probes |
| Quality review | PASS at `781de2b1`; all disclosure, repeated-wait, transport-classification, and unknown-action findings repaired |
| Full gate | 67 passed; Ruff passed; docs 457 pages; 0 broken links; `git diff --check` passed |
| Final implementation | `4bc76c83`, `be307d4b`, `781de2b1` |
