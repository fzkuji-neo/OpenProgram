# Record/Replay Reliability Task Brief and Ledger

## Contract

- Approved design: `docs/reference/design/providers/record-replay.html`.
- Base commit: `990bfe36e625579443e1cb01a1b3266c8dbd0e87`.
- Production files: `openprogram/providers/recording.py`, `openprogram/providers/replay.py`, `openprogram/providers/api_registry.py`, `openprogram/providers/__init__.py`.
- Test files: `tests/providers/test_record_replay.py`, `tests/providers/test_record_replay_registry.py`.
- Public-entry RED cases:
  - provider exception, task cancellation, and consumer `aclose()` leave a parseable terminal call and close the source generator;
  - invalid startup record/replay configuration does not abort package import, does not resolve credentials, and cannot fall back to a live provider;
  - replay mismatch does not consume the recorded call, while a matched interrupted call consumes exactly once.
- Compatibility: old v1 `call_end` rows without `outcome` remain complete; existing constructors, exception attributes, normal recordings, and strict-offline behavior remain valid.
- Security/privacy: activation failure is fail-closed; no credential resolution or network fallback; terminal metadata contains only a fixed outcome enum and no exception text.
- Cancellation/concurrency: preserve `CancelledError` and `GeneratorExit`; always close the wrapped source; one terminal row per call.
- Exclusions: structured-output retry budgeting, O(N^2) indexing, additional redaction fields, arbitrary replay path policy, Windows work, Web UI, tool/MCP recording, and unrelated audit findings.

## Ledger

| Evidence | Result |
|---|---|
| Base | `990bfe36e625579443e1cb01a1b3266c8dbd0e87` |
| Design revision | `1d6f52ec` |
| RED | `pytest -q tests/providers/test_record_replay.py tests/providers/test_record_replay_registry.py` -> 5 failed, 22 passed; each failure matched a named public behavior. Invalid outcome mutation proof -> 1 failed as expected. |
| GREEN | Same two files -> 27 passed. |
| Affected verification | Record/replay, CLI management, and stream chokepoint -> 45 passed; scoped Ruff passed; `git diff --check` passed. |
| Specification review | Initial `CHANGES_REQUIRED`: synchronous `stream`/`stream_simple` source construction failures occurred before `begin_call`; repair RED was 2 failed, then 47 affected tests passed. Scoped re-review `PASS` at `a4f27b3b`. |
| Quality review | Initial `CHANGES_REQUIRED`: duplicate terminal events wrote multiple `call_end` rows; fail-closed activation could not replace an existing transform. Repair RED was 2 failed. Scoped re-review found terminal `return` swallowed source-close errors; repair RED was 1 failed. Final scoped re-review `PASS` at `6595d444`; affected suite passed 50 tests. |
| Full gate | Final candidate: 50 passed; scoped Ruff passed; docs built 453 pages; 0 broken links; `git diff --check` passed; isolated worktree clean. |
| Final implementation commit | `6595d444`; review evidence documentation through `da53b4c8`. |
